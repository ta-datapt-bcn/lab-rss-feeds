During COVID-19, Zoom-enabled tech workers have discovered the benefits of remote work from cheaper, less congested communities elsewhere. Is this the end of Silicon Valley as we know it? Perhaps. But other challenges to Silicon Valley’s preeminence are more fundamental than the tech diaspora.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Understanding four trends that may shape the future of Silicon Valley is also a road map to some of the biggest technology-enabled opportunities of the next decades:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li>Consumer internet entrepreneurs lack many of the skills needed for the life sciences revolution.</li><li>Internet regulation is upon us.</li><li>Climate response is capital intensive, and inherently local.</li><li>The end of the betting economy.</li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Inventing the future</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“The best way to predict the future is to invent it,” <a href=\"https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/09/27/invent-the-future/\">Alan Kay once said</a>. 2020 proved him both right and wrong. The coronavirus pandemic, or something worse, had long been predicted,&nbsp;but it still caught the world unprepared, a better future not yet invented. Climate change too has been on the radar, not just for decades but for over a century, since <a href=\"https://www.rsc.org/images/Arrhenius1896_tcm18-173546.pdf\">Arrhenius’s 1896 paper on the greenhouse effect</a>. And it has long been known that inequality and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Caste-Origins-Discontents-Isabel-Wilkerson/dp/0593230256/\">caste</a> are corrosive to social stability and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Why_Nations_Fail\">predict the fate of nations</a>. Yet again and again the crisis finds us unprepared when it comes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In each case, though, the long-predicted future is still not foreordained. <em>It is up to us whether we are steamrollered by events beyond our control or whether we have the collective power to invent a better future.</em> Awakening may have come later than we might have wished, but crises like the pandemic and climate change can still be massive drivers of innovation. If entrepreneurs, investors, and governments step up to solve the hard problems that we face today, the future remains bright. But one thing is certain: the inventions we most urgently need will take us in a very different direction than the consumer internet and social media revolution that is coming to an unsightly end.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The coronavirus is a case in point. The explosion of biomedical invention that it has accelerated may well have impacts that extend well beyond the pandemic itself. <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243\">mRNA vaccines</a> have given us a promising path to COVID immunity, developed in record time. <a href=\"https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html\">Moderna’s vaccine was created within only two days</a> after Chinese scientist Yong-Zhen Zhang released the genetic sequence of the virus! And mRNA vaccines are also easily tweaked, raising the possibility of even quicker response to mutations, and even the creation of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243\">a framework for rapid development of many more vaccines.</a> We are starting to see the payoff of radically new approaches to biomedical innovation, and in particular, the way that machine learning is turbocharging research. During 2020, <a href=\"https://www.stateof.ai/\">more than 21,000 biomedical research papers made reference to AI and machine learning</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large is-resized\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13666\" height=\"327\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/02/Tim_article-1048x591.png\" width=\"580\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recent announcement by DeepMind that its AlphaFold technology is able to <a href=\"https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology\">predict protein structure with accuracy comparable to slow and costly experimental methods</a> is a harbinger of breakthroughs to come. As geneticist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/timjph/status/1333438139529048067\">Tim Hubbard wrote</a>, “The genomes we believed were blueprints for life were effectively encrypted—this will unlock them and transform biological and biomedical research.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: The nexus of machine learning and medicine, biology, and materials science will be to the coming decades what Silicon Valley has been to the late 20th and early 21st century.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Why might this mark the end of Silicon Valley as we know it? First, the required skills are different. Yes, machine learning, statistical analysis, and programming are all needed, but so is deep knowledge of relevant science. The hubs where that knowledge can be found are not the special province of Silicon Valley, suggesting that other regions may take the lead. Second, many of the markets where fortunes will be made are regulated; navigating regulated markets also takes skills that are conspicuously missing in Silicon Valley. Finally, as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theranos\">Theranos</a> demonstrated so vividly, it is harder to sustain a hype balloon in a scientific enterprise than in many of the markets where Silicon Valley has prospered. Many Silicon Valley investors have been lucky rather than smart. They may not do so well in a world where capital must be directed toward solving hard problems rather than toward winning a popularity contest.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Mastering “the demons of our own design”</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The opportunity of machine learning in scientific R&amp;D is profound. But machine learning also challenges our current approach to science, which relies on human theorizing and experiments. A machine learning model may be able to make successful predictions but not to explain them. When Arthur C. Clarke wrote <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws\">“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,”</a> was he imagining a future in which our own science would leave our understanding behind? As <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/to-build-truly-intelligent-machines-teach-them-cause-and-effect-20180515/\">Judea Pearl has noted</a>, excessive identification of correlations (i.e, &#8220;curve fitting&#8221;) makes the definition of authentic causal relationships more challenging. And &#8220;real science&#8221; needs causal relationships.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I suspect that we will come to terms with machine learning-enabled science, just as we’ve come to terms with instruments that let us see far beyond the capabilities of the naked eye. But without a better understanding of our machine helpers, we may set them down paths that take us to the edge of a cliff, much as we’ve done with social media and our fractured information landscape.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That fractured landscape is not what was predicted—internet pioneers expected freedom and the wisdom of crowds, not that we would all be under the thumb of giant corporations profiting from a market in disinformation. What we invented was not what we hoped for. The internet became the stuff of our nightmares rather than of our dreams. We can still recover, but at least so far, Silicon Valley appears to be part of the problem more than it is part of the solution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Can technology platforms rein in the demons of our own design (to use <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Demon-Our-Own-Design-Innovation/dp/0470393750\">Richard Bookstaber’s memorable phrase</a>)? That too will be one of the challenges that shape the coming decades.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Government regulators in Europe and the US have set their sights on Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Apple, but the regulatory responses will be insufficient if they are based on old theories, old understandings that the platforms have already outstripped. The US theory of antitrust has largely been based on the question of consumer harm, which is difficult to prove in marketplaces where services are provided to consumers at zero cost and where the marginal cost of experimenting on those consumers is also close to zero. The emerging European regulatory effort is properly focused on the role of dominant tech firms as “<a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en\">gatekeepers</a>.” It aims to systematically limit their ability to shape the market for their own advantage. Its remedies, though, are blunt, and the processes for assessing harms will most likely proceed more slowly than the harms themselves.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Markets are ecosystems, and like other ecosystems, there are hidden dependencies everywhere. The harm of Google abusing its monopoly position will not show up first in harm to consumers, but in depressed profits, decreased R&amp;D investment, and lower wages at the web companies to whom Google once directed traffic. For Amazon, it will show up in the increased fees and advertising costs required to show up in product search.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These harms to the supply side of marketplace platforms, with the majority of the gains being captured by the winner of <a href=\"https://qz.com/1540608/the-problem-with-silicon-valleys-obsession-with-blitzscaling-growth/\">the winner-takes-all model that Silicon Valley has encouraged</a>, do eventually cascade to consumers. But because the pain is widely distributed and because the platforms are not required to report the information that would make it visible, the problem will not be obvious until much of the damage is irreversible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When the “<a href=\"https://economics.mit.edu/files/12979\">superstar firms</a>” ruthlessly compete with smaller firms that come up with fresh ideas, not only starving them of talent but often introducing copycat products and services, there is decreased innovation from the market as a whole. Cities are dominated by a new class of highly paid big-company employees driving up housing costs and forcing out lower wage workers; wages and working conditions of workers in less profitable industries are squeezed to drive the growth of the giants. Their very jobs are made contingent and disposable, with inequality baked in from the beginning of their employment. Governments are starved of revenue by giant companies that have mastered the art of tax avoidance. The list is far longer than that.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the case of social media platforms, manipulation of users for profit has frayed the fabric of democracy and the respect for truth. Silicon Valley, which once harnessed the collective intelligence of its users, now uses its deep knowledge of its users to “trade against them.” (<a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2007/12/trading-for-their-own-account.html\">I predicted the broad outline of this turn back in 2007</a>, after conversations with venture capitalist and economist Bill Janeway <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/release2-issue2.pdf\">about what we might learn from Wall Street about the future of the internet</a>.) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technology is far from the only offender. It is merely the most visible mirror of our values as a society. The extractive behavior the tech giants exhibit has been the norm for modern capitalism since Milton Friedman set its objective function in 1970: “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html\">The social responsibility of business is to increase its profits</a>.” This is all the sadder, though, since the tech industry set out to model something better. The generosity of open source software and the World Wide Web, the genius of algorithmically amplified collective intelligence are still there, pointing the way to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/topics/next-economy/\">the Next Economy</a>, but it is an economy we must actively choose, rather than riding the rails of a system that is taking us in the wrong direction.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: Because platform businesses have failed to regulate themselves, they will have limits placed on their potential for good as well as harm.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s a sad time for Silicon Valley, because we are seeing not only the death of its youthful idealism but a missed opportunity. <a href=\"https://www.sci.pitt.edu/people/paul-cohen\">Paul Cohen</a>, the former DARPA program manager for AI, made a powerful statement a few years ago at a meeting of the National Academy of Sciences that we both attended: “The opportunity of AI is to help humans model and manage complex interacting systems.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That statement sums up so much of the potential that is squandered when firms like Google, Amazon, and Facebook fall prey to the Friedman doctrine rather than setting more ambitious goals for their algorithms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m not talking about future breakthroughs in AI so much as I’m talking about the fundamental advances in market coordination that the internet gatekeepers have demonstrated. These powers can be used to better model and manage complex interacting systems for the good of all. Too often, though, they have been made subservient to the old extractive paradigm.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To explain what I mean requires a small aside.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Free market economists believe that the willingness of producers and consumers to agree on prices at which they will exchange goods or services (in idealized markets that are characterized by perfect competition with no asymmetries of power or information) leads to the best allocation of society’s resources. The solution to complex equations representing supply chains of self-interest is expressed in these market prices. Money, in effect, is the coordinating power behind Adam Smith’s “invisible hand.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like the anonymous internet wag <a href=\"https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/practice-and-theory/\">who wrote</a>, “The difference between theory and practice is always greater in practice than it is in theory,” economists recognize that perfect competition exists only in theory, that “externalities” exist where costs are borne by people other than the buyer and the seller, and that few markets are completely efficient. The role of the state, in many ways, is to address the shortcomings of the market. Diane Coyle’s book <a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691179261/markets-state-and-people\"><em>Markets, State, and People</em></a> gives an excellent account of how economic policy makers think about the trade-offs they make when they intervene. Even at their best, though, the available interventions—taxes, monetary policy, and regulations—are piecemeal and take years or decades to agree on and implement. (<a href=\"https://www.worldbank.org/en/programs/pricing-carbon\">Carbon pricing</a> is a case in point.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Google’s search engine has given us a convincing demonstration of a radically different method for managing an economic system. Constantly refined, dynamic, and infused with AI, Google’s algorithmic systems demonstrate that it is possible to manage an economy in ways not imagined by 20th century economists. 40,000 times a second, 3.5 billion times a day, Google’s centrally managed search performs the magic that, for so long, was thought to be the unique province of decentralized, self-interested actors transacting in priced markets.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In a brilliant stroke, Google built an algorithmic system that uses hundreds of distinct information signals to make the best match between tens of millions of information providers and billions of information consumers—<em>but price is not one of those signals</em>. That is not to say that Google does not participate in the money economy. Far from it. But&nbsp; for Google’s first decade and a half, the priced market of pay-per-click advertising was a sidecar to the primary matching marketplace of search. The initial genius of Google was to run the market coordinated by collective intelligence (organic search) and the market coordinated by money (pay per click advertising) in parallel. And when producers with economic motivations manipulated organic search results for profit but to the detriment of Google’s users, producing pages that satisfied the algorithms but failed to satisfy consumers, <a href=\"https://martinwilson.info/history-of-google-algorithm-updates-killed-businesses/\">Google was ruthless in updating the algorithms</a> to focus on consumer benefit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To be sure, a great deal of content on the World Wide Web and in social media is produced and consumed with commercial intent, but a remarkable amount is produced entirely without a profit motive. Google economists have told me that only six percent of Google search result pages carry any advertising at all. The other 94% of pages are the product of the joyful exuberance of humanity, creating and sharing for the joy of it. If there has ever been a harbinger of a possible economy of abundance, we can see it in the best of the internet sharing economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In recent years, though, Google has increasingly blurred the lines between the two information markets it manages (the price-free market of search and the priced market of advertising). <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/10/19/google-search-results-monopoly/\">And that has made commercially valuable search results less effective than those that have no purely economic value.</a> That is, Google appears to match information producers and consumers<em> more effectively</em> in the absence of the distorting power of money.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So too Amazon. Unlike Google, Amazon has always used price as an important signal in its search rankings, but price was intelligently combined with measures of collective opinion—what other consumers thought was the best product—to create a market that was more efficient than any previous consumer goods marketplace. But in recent years, with the introduction of search advertising as a major new revenue line, Amazon too has turned away from using the tools of collective intelligence to find the best products for its customers. Its search is now dominated by “featured” products—that is, products that producers have paid to put in front of consumers. With advertising now one of the biggest drivers of Amazon’s profits, it is hard to imagine that the company can remain, as Jeff Bezos has proudly boasted, the most consumer-centric platform on earth. I wrote about this problem at length last year, in “<a href=\"https://qz.com/1666863/why-big-tech-keeps-outsmarting-antitrust-regulators/\">Antitrust regulators are using the wrong tools to regulate big tech</a>.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So many of the problems that antitrust actions and other regulations are now gearing up to address are, paradoxically, the result of the prime directive by which our economic and legal system governs its corporations: “Thou must maximize profits.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The notion of maximizing profit is so ingrained in our society that in 2014, when Facebook researchers published a paper called “<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788\">Experimental Evidence of Massive-Scale Emotional Contagion Through Social Networks</a>,” the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/30/technology/facebook-tinkers-with-users-emotions-in-news-feed-experiment-stirring-outcry.html\">response was swift and savage</a>. It was considered a terrible breach of research ethics to test whether the mix of stories in the Facebook news feed made its readers happier or sadder. The reaction was particularly striking because no one seemed to notice that Silicon Valley explicitly celebrates and teaches its entrepreneurs how to manipulate the emotional state of users, calling it “<a href=\"https://smile.amazon.com/Hacking-Growth-Fastest-Growing-Companies-Breakout/dp/045149721X/\">growth hacking</a>” or “<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing\">A/B testing</a>” or “<a href=\"http://amazon.com/Hooked-How-Build-Habit-Forming-Products/dp/1591847788/\">creating habit-forming products</a>.” No one complains about <em>these</em> experiments. It’s considered a best practice to experiment on your customers as long as it is in pursuit of growth and profits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Because the cost of those experiments is so low—it’s a sunk cost of the business—experimental mistakes and unforeseen consequences are only to be expected. They become a new class of externality little considered by economists and regulators.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In retrospect, some formal experimentation on emotional contagion and reflection on its implications would have been a good idea. Instead, we continue to run global-scale unsupervised experiments on the power of social media to spread negative emotional contagion for profit, while any effort by the platforms to influence their users in positive directions is still considered by many to be inappropriate intervention, or is abandoned because it might reduce user activity and growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, during the 2020 US presidential election, Facebook engineers reportedly trained a machine learning algorithm to recognize posts that their users would consider “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/technology/facebook-election-misinformation.html\">bad for the world</a>,” but the company found that showing fewer of them reduced the number of user sessions and thus, presumably revenue and profits. So they retrained the algorithm to find the point where “bad for the world” posts were reduced but not by so much that they impacted user sessions. Other changes to optimize for “news ecosystem quality” were put in place for a few weeks leading up to the election, but reversed thereafter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Shareholder value” is so ingrained in corporate governance that a special class of corporation, “<a href=\"https://socialenterprise.us/resources/news/b-corps-public-benefit-corporations/\">the public benefit corporation</a>,” has been defined to protect companies that are managed to take other considerations than profit into account. All “normal” companies are expected to treat employees, the environment, and society as costs to be minimized, avoided, or eliminated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Silicon Valley is a mirror of what is wrong with our economy and corporate governance, not the cause of it, or even the worst exemplar.</em> (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3490543/\">Tobacco</a>, <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/usa/global-warming/exxon-and-the-oil-industry-knew-about-climate-change/exxons-climate-denial-history-a-timeline/\">oil</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7357445/\">pharma</a> companies vie for the top spot.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In many ways, regulators can still learn from Silicon Valley. Our economy too is shaped by invisible algorithms and embedded objectives. If regulators can see the analogies between the way Google, Amazon, and Facebook’s algorithms shape their services and the way that law, tax, and monetary policy shape who gets what and why in our society, and why corporate leaders act the way they do, we can use the current moment to improve not only Silicon Valley but the fairness and the goals of our entire economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As I wrote last year in “<a href=\"https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/we-have-already-let-the-genie-out-of-the-bottle/\">We Have Already Let the Genie Out of the Bottle</a>,” an essay for a Rockefeller Foundation workshop on regulating AI, our corporations and our government and our markets are what science fiction writer Charlie Stross calls “<a href=\"https://boingboing.net/2017/12/29/llcs-are-slow-ais.html\">slow AIs.</a>” I made the case that we cannot regulate them without rebuilding the rules by which they operate:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Attempts at governance…are futile until we recognize that we have built a machine and set it on its course. Instead, we pretend that the market is a natural phenomenon best left alone, and we fail to hold its mechanism designers to account. We need to tear down and rebuild that machine, reprogramming it so that human flourishing, not corporate profit, becomes its goal. We need to understand that we can’t just state our values. We must implement them in a way that our machines can understand and execute.”</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Silicon Valley can still lead in this effort. The big platforms must understand their social responsibility to <a href=\"https://www.petershallard.com/create-more-value-than-you-capture/#:~:text=Creating%20more%20value%20than%20you%20capture%20is%20a%20philosophy%20of,don\\'t%20show%20up).\">create more value than they capture</a>, focus their algorithmic systems on improving human welfare, find ways to measure and communicate the value that they create, and help our broader society to better “model and manage complex interacting systems.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The danger of regulatory response that simply tries to turn back the clock and doesn’t take into account the ways technology done right could point the way forward is illustrated by the battle over <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_California_Proposition_22\">California’s Proposition 22</a>. Its passage overturned state regulations requiring gig economy companies to treat their workers as employees rather than independent contractors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional labor protections and benefits assumed a world in which individuals worked for a single employer. An attempt to impose those assumptions on companies reliant on gig workers was seen as an existential threat by those companies, who mounted a massive campaign against the new rules. Their customers agreed, and regulations were rolled back by the will of the public.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The gig economy companies have made some small steps toward flexible benefits on their own, but they are a pale shadow of what they might have been if the companies and their gig workers and their customers, not to mention their regulators, had been working together to build systems that would allow benefits to be managed as dynamically as employment. In the German model of stakeholder capitalism, workers are at the management table rather than pitted against the companies they work for. Is there a 21st century version of stakeholder capitalism yet to be designed, one that is not zero-sum but instead “models and manages complex interacting systems” to find better solutions for all?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As I argued five years ago in “<a href=\"https://wtfeconomy.com/workers-in-a-world-of-continuous-partial-employment-4d7b53f18f96\">Workers in a World of Continuous Partial Employment</a>,” we need a much more robust benefit system that is centered on the worker, not on the company. The gig economy companies are not outliers. Continuous partial employment has become the norm in much of the economy. A combination of the rise of the Friedman doctrine and the demise of labor unions has reset the balance of power between companies and their workers. The legislative and regulatory response needs to address this power imbalance systematically, across the entire labor economy, using the capabilities of technology to create new models of cooperation between companies and their workers, and a safety net that catches everyone, not just a lucky few.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Climate change and the energy economy</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The recent news that Elon Musk is one of the world’s richest people is also a harbinger of the biggest opportunity of the 21st century: to avert climate change. Electric vehicles are the tip of the iceberg. Heating and cooling, agriculture, raw materials and manufacturing—all need reinvention. Climate will reshape residential and office construction, insurance, finance, and where and how food is produced. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/07/23/magazine/climate-migration.html\">Massive climate migrations have only just begun</a>; tens or hundreds of millions of people will need to be resettled. Will we offer them shantytowns, or will we help them become settlers building a new, better world?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: There will be more climate billionaires created in the next two decades than in the internet boom.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With the exception of Musk, many of the already-minted climate billionaires are outside the US, highlighting the way that other countries already have the lead in these industries of the future. <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2020-green-billionaires/\">Bloomberg recently named a few</a>: China’s Zeng Yuqun, Huang Shilin, Pei Zhenhua, and Li Ping (electric vehicle batteries), Li Zhenguo, Li Chunan, and Li Xiyan (solar panels and films), Lin Jianhua (solar panels and films), and Wang Chuanfu (electric vehicles); Germany’s Aloys Wobben (wind turbines); and Spain’s Jose Manuel Entrecanales (renewable power generation).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are great fortunes yet to be made, of course. While <a href=\"https://www.impossiblefoods.com/\">Impossible Foods</a> CEO Patrick Brown and <a href=\"https://www.beyondmeat.com/\">Beyond Meat</a> founder Ethan Brown (no relation) and <a href=\"https://www.plenty.ag/about-us/\">Plenty</a>’s Matt Barnard, <a href=\"https://boweryfarming.com/\">Bowery</a>’s Irving Fain, or <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/news/nordic-harvest-hydroponic-farms/\">Nordic Harvest&#8217;s Anders Riemann</a> are not yet billionaires, it is quite possible that they will be. But for the most part, Silicon Valley entrepreneurs and investors are not leaders in this sector.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In any case, who will get rich helping us transition to a new energy economy is unimportant compared to the question of whether we will summon the political will to make the transition in time to avoid the most disastrous consequences of climate change, which could, at their worst, bring an end to civilization as we know it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A strong argument can be made that only a crash mobilization of the economy to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2016/9/19/12938086/electrify-everything\">electrify everything</a> can get us there in time. Saul Griffith, Alex Laskey, and Sam Calisch of the nonprofit <a href=\"http://rewiringamerica.org/\">Rewiring America</a> have made just that argument. And here, the algorithms that guide our economy to focus on “efficiency” need to be questioned. As economist and former venture capitalist Bill Janeway said to me, mobilizations can get hung up and stalled out due to excessive concern with efficiency as the dominant metric of value.&nbsp; “World War II was won on ‘the&nbsp; momentum of production,’ “ he noted, quoting from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Struggle-Survival-Elliott-Janeway/dp/0911548521\"><em>The Struggle for Survival</em></a>, his father Eliot Janeway’s book about the World War II mobilization. “Similarly the WPA put millions to work during the Depression precisely because effective employment—not efficiency—was the dominant goal.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are five pillars to Rewiring America’s case for electrification as the answer to our urgent need to limit greenhouse gas emissions:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>1. <strong>Electrifying everything requires only half as much energy as our current system.</strong> Saul and his team worked with the US Department of Energy in 2018 to create a<a href=\"http://departmentof.energy/\">n interactive map</a> of <a href=\"https://www.otherlab.com/blog-posts/us-energy-flow-super-sankey\">all the source-to-use energy flows in America</a>. This map of our energy economy was started under the Nixon administration, but its true implications are only now being realized. One of the surprising consequences of their analysis is that half the energy we use is spent collectively on things like mining and transporting fossil fuels, and in thermoelectric losses from converting them to electricity, to heat, or to movement. Direct electrification of as much of our economy as possible is not only achievable but also the fastest way to avert climate disaster.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>2. <strong>We need to reconceive solar panels, batteries, electric cars, and electric appliances as part of our national energy infrastructure</strong>, even when they are on or in people&#8217;s homes, rather than thinking of infrastructure as something owned only by utilities or the government. Electric heat pumps can be used for both hot water and home heating; hot water storage can in effect act as a battery, heating up with solar electricity during the day and giving heat back at night. We won&#8217;t balance a future renewables-heavy grid without using local (i.e., home and business) batteries and thermal loads (water and space heat) as part of the overall demand response and storage.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>3. <strong>Markets won&#8217;t move fast enough without a World War II-style mobilization of private industry.</strong> We need a heroic 4–5 year effort to get to 100% transformation of our energy infrastructure. Otherwise, we will have to wait for the natural replacement rate on infrastructure, which will take decades that we don’t have. That heroic 4–5 year effort gets us to the scale of production appropriate to enable 100% adoption of the solution technologies, which will then require a consistent 10–20 year rollout beyond that initial ramp-up period.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>4. <strong>Electrifying the US will create jobs—lots of them.</strong> Rewiring America estimates that such an effort could, at peak, <a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90533448/how-to-create-25-million-jobs-by-decarbonizing-the-economy\">create as many as 25 million US jobs</a>, and 5 million ongoing jobs in the new industries. The cost of the retrofit will be high, but so will the payoff, in both jobs and in savings to consumers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rooftop solar can produce at most 25% of the total needs of a fully electrified economy, so there&#8217;s still plenty of room and need for grid-scale solar—the electrified economy will require 3x the capacity of the current grid—but local is the cheapest energy and the best way to pass savings to the consumer, as well as to create highly localized jobs across the country.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rooftop solar jobs are of necessity geographically decentralized, potentially enabling an ecosystem of small local firms rather than rewarding a few giants.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>5. <strong>Who gets the financial benefit of this massive investment—utilities, solar installers, or consumers—depends on interest rates.</strong><br />&#8220;The miracle technology is much more likely to be finance than it is to be fusion,&#8221; Saul said in a recent presentation. Arguably, it was the invention of the auto loan by Alfred P. Sloan of General Motors and the later financial innovation by the Roosevelt administration of the Federal Housing Authority and the home mortgage that created the US middle class, he noted. &#8220;Mortgages are time machines that let you have the future you want today.&#8221; We need something similar for the electrification transformation. Otherwise, &#8220;only rich people can afford to decarbonize today.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Utilities already have access to low-cost loans. But consumers don&#8217;t, and if you want to create both jobs and cost savings for consumers, <a href=\"https://www.rewiringamerica.org/household-savings-report\">low-cost interest rates for home electrification are the best way to do it</a>. Otherwise, the savings all get captured by middlemen, or by utilities, and adoption is much slower.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This observation is entirely in line with my broader point that regulations and the tax code play much the same role in shaping who gets what and why in markets as do the controlling algorithms in online platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>The end of casino capitalism?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The final, and perhaps most important, reason why Silicon Valley as we know it may be over is that its current incarnation is a product of the extraordinarily cheap capital of the years since the global financial crisis of 2009.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are two economies, often confused: the operating economy, in which companies make and sell products and services, and the betting economy, in which wealthy people bet on which companies will win and which will lose in the beauty contest that stock markets have become. In the operating economy, the measure of success is, as Nick Hanauer and Eric Beinhocker memorably put it, “<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/long-term-capitalism/redefining-capitalism\">the solution to human problems</a>.” Companies compete to solve those problems more effectively and earn a profit thereby. Along the way, they employ people productively, create valuable new goods and services, and contribute to their communities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the betting economy, the measure of success is stock price, the higher the better. Fueled by massive money creation by central banks, capital is abundant (for those who, by virtue of existing wealth, already have access to it), and traditional sources of return, such as interest on loans or ROI on investment in plants and equipment or employees, are dwarfed by the potential returns that can be achieved by playing on the madness of crowds. What can you call it but a bubble when <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/business/dealbook/roblox-tech-ipos.html\">the median valuation of this past year’s tech IPOs was 24 times trailing revenue</a>, while tech IPOs during most of the past decade were only valued at about six times trailing revenue. Data collected by University of Florida professor Jay Ritter shows that it’s even worse than it appears: <a href=\"https://site.warrington.ufl.edu/ritter/files/IPO-Statistics.pdf\">only 16% of 2020’s tech IPOs had any profits at all</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Capital markets do play an important role in our society. Bets on an unknown future are an important way to fund innovation and to build out infrastructure in advance of the prosperity that it will bring once that innovation has been widely deployed. But in today’s <a href=\"https://evonomics.com/financialization-hidden-illness-rana-foorohar/\">financialized economy</a>, the returns on betting for its own sake have grown far faster than the returns on true operating investment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many who will argue that the enormous payoffs coming to today’s entrepreneurs and investors are the result of their world-changing innovations. History suggests otherwise. There was plenty of innovation when the returns to investors and entrepreneurs were a fraction of what they are today.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Silicon Valley is named for the semiconductor manufacturing companies that became the foundation of all that followed. Intel, one of the most successful of those companies, went public in 1971 with a valuation of about $58 million (<a href=\"https://www.in2013dollars.com/us/inflation/1971?amount=58\">about $372 million in today’s dollars</a>). Intel had a small profit when it went public, but it went on to earn hundreds of billions of dollars in operating profit over the succeeding decades. Apple and Microsoft, the standard bearers of the next generation of Silicon Valley companies, were also profitable at IPO. Two decades later, Google too was highly profitable when it went public, and while Amazon was one of the first companies to legitimize the profitless IPO, <a href=\"https://news.crunchbase.com/news/why-amazons-history-of-ipo-era-losses-means-little-for-todays-unprofitable-unicorns/\">its losses were falling as it grew</a>. All have turned into companies that generate enormous profits in the operating economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Few of the companies in the recent crop of Silicon Valley companies can make that claim. At its IPO early in 2020, Palantir had <a href=\"https://www.computerworld.com/article/3562713/biggest-tech-ipos-2020.html\">prior year revenues of $743 million, on which it posted a loss of $576 million</a>. Uber went public in 2019 with <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1543151/000119312519103850/d647752ds1.htm#rom647752_8a\">an operating loss of over $3 billion on $11 billion in revenue</a>. When DoorDash went public, it had <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm#rom752207_9\">revenues of $1.92 billion for the trailing nine months, on which it had a net loss of $149 million</a>. All these companies have valuations in the tens of billions, making their founders and investors very rich, despite not making any money at all in the operating economy. In many cases, the money invested in these companies was used to create the illusion of growth, acquiring customers below the cost of delivering services to them. It is money invested in the promise of more money, a kind of Ponzi scheme decoupled from the operating economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Intel’s stock market investors were making a rational bet that a world-changing technology would earn a huge stream of future profits. Palantir’s, Uber’s, and DoorDash’s investors were betting on how other investors might value their stocks, much as 16th century Dutch investors bet on the “value” of unique tulips or mid-19th century British investors bet on the prospects for railroads in distant countries, many of which were never built. Some of these companies may eventually turn an operating profit, but it is likely that when they do, investors will realize that those profits don’t justify the sky-high valuations, which will then come back down to earth. As Benjamin Graham, the father of the style of value investing favored by Warren Buffett, is reported to have said, “In the short run, the market is a voting machine. In the long run, it is a weighing machine.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Were Gordon Moore and Robert Noyce, the founders of Intel, less motivated to build world-changing products because the proceeds were orders of magnitude less than they are for today’s Silicon Valley entrepreneurs? I suspect that it is the other way around. The easy profits from today’s financial betting markets encourage <a href=\"https://delong.typepad.com/baumol-1990-entrepreneurship.pdf\">unproductive innovation</a>. I’d take Gordon Moore over WeWork’s Adam Neumann any day. When investors and entrepreneurs who promise future innovation but are unable to deliver it still walk away with billions, something is seriously wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As John Maynard Keynes wrote in his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_General_Theory_of_Employment,_Interest_and_Money\"><em>General Theory</em></a> during the depths of the Great Depression, “Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the position is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation. When the capital development of a country becomes a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem is that money “invested” in the betting economy is not really invested. It is spent, just like money at the gaming table. When the WeWork bubble popped, the money SoftBank had spent propping up its valuation might just as well have gone up in smoke. The end of this process could look something like the financial crisis of 2009. Money invested in the collateralized debt obligations of the first decade of this century was not backed by true worth in the operating economy, so when the CDOs went bust, the money simply vanished.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Prediction: When the bubble ends, greater opportunities will remain.</strong></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the gifts—if you can call it that—of crises like the pandemic and climate change is that they may teach us that we no longer have time for frivolity. We need our investment capital to flow back to the operating economy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There is <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/welcome-to-the/9781492089247/\">a robust strategy</a> for investors and entrepreneurs: Work on stuff that matters. Invest in solving problems. Make a real difference in people’s lives. You will know you have done that when operating profits fairly earned, not stock market gains, are your measure of investment success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two of the big areas of innovation that I highlight in this essay—life sciences and climate change—require large amounts of real investment capital. Unlike money invested in internet companies that used it to buy unprofitable growth, money invested in Tesla was used to build factories, to manufacture cars and electric batteries, and to roll out national charging networks.The path to high returns may take longer, but the need is real, and so is the value created.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Solving global crises requires the best of what we have to offer. If the best way to predict the future is to invent it, it’s time we got busy. Which world do we want to invent? It’s up to us.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/dHbA6ByfR5w\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

But these problems are squarely within the domain of traditional AI. Playing Chess and Go or building ever-better language models have been AI projects for decades. The following projects have a different flavor:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>In February, PLOS Genetics published an article by researchers who are using GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks) to <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1009303\">create artificial human genomes</a>.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Another group of researchers published an article about using NLP (natural language processing) to analyze viral genomes and, specifically, to <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/14/1016162/ai-language-nlp-coronavirus-hiv-flu-mutations-antinbodies-immune-vaccines/\">predict the behavior of mutations</a>. They were able to distinguish between errors in &#8220;syntax&#8221; (which make the gene non-viable), and changes in semantics (which result in a viable virus that functions differently).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Yet another group of researchers modelled a small portion of a fruit fly&#8217;s brain (the part used for smell), and were able to train that to <a href=\"https://www.discovermagazine.com/the-sciences/fruit-fly-brain-network-hacked-for-language-processing\">create a model for natural language processing</a>. This new model appears to be orders of magnitude more efficient than state-of-the-art models like GPT-3.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The common thread through these advances is applying work in one field to another area that’s apparently unrelated—not sustained research at cracking a core AI problem. Using NLP to analyze mutations? That&#8217;s brilliant—and it&#8217;s one of those brilliant things that sounds so obvious once you think about it. And it&#8217;s an area where NLP may have a real significant advantage because it <em>doesn&#8217;t</em> actually understand language, any more than humans understand DNA.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The ability to create artificial human genomes is important in the short term because the human genome data available to researchers is limited by privacy laws. Synthetic genomes aren&#8217;t subject to privacy laws, because they don&#8217;t belong to any person. Data limitations aren’t a new problem; AI researchers frequently face the problem of finding sufficient data to train a model. So they have developed a lot of techniques for generating &#8220;synthetic&#8221; data: for example, cropping, rotating, or distorting pictures to get more data for image recognition. Once you’ve realized that it’s possible to create synthetic data, the jump to creating synthetic genomes isn’t far-fetched; you just have to make the connection. Asking where it might lead in the long term is even more important.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s not hard to come up with more examples of surprising work that comes from bringing techniques from one field into another. <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/dall-e/\">DALL-E</a> (which combines NLP with image analysis to create a new image from a description) is another example. So is <a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3432202\">ShadowSense</a>, which uses image analysis to let robots determine when they are touched.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These results suggest that we&#8217;re at the start of something new. The world isn&#8217;t a better place because computers can play Go; but it may become a better place if we can understand how our genomes work. Using adversarial techniques outside of game play or NLP techniques outside of language will inevitably lead to solving the problems we <em>actually</em> need to solve. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s really only half the story. While we may be on the edge of making great advances in applications, we aren&#8217;t making the same advances in fairness and justice. Here are some key indicators:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Attempts to train models to predict the pain that Black patients will suffer as a result of medical procedures have largely failed. Recently, research discovered that the models were more successful if they got their training data by <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/22/1016577/ai-fairer-healthcare-patient-outcomes/\">actually listening to Black patients</a>, rather than just using records from their doctors.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>A study by MIT discovered that training predictive crime models on crime reports rather than arrests doesn&#8217;t make them less racist. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Fortunately, the doctors modeling medical pain decided to listen to their Black patients; unfortunately, that kind of listening is still rare. Listening to Black patients shouldn&#8217;t be a breakthrough akin to using NLP to analyze DNA. Why weren’t we listening to the patients in the first place? And why are the patients’ assessments of their pain so different from the doctors’?&nbsp; This is clearly progress, but more than that, it’s a sign of how much progress has yet to be made in treating minorities fairly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>And I&#8217;m afraid that MIT has only discovered that there aren&#8217;t any historical data sources about crime that aren&#8217;t biased, something we already knew. If you look at so-called &#8220;white collar&#8221; crime, Midtown Manhattan is the most dangerous neighborhood in New York. But that&#8217;s not where the police are spending their time.&nbsp; The only somewhat tongue-in-cheek <a href=\"https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/static/whitepaper.pdf\">paper</a> accompanying the map of <a href=\"https://whitecollar.thenewinquiry.com/\">White Collar Crime Risk Zones</a> suggests that their next step will be using “facial features to quantify the ‘criminality’ of the individual.”&nbsp; That would clearly be a joke if such techniques weren’t already <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-53165286\">under development</a>, and not just in China.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It looks like we&#8217;re at the cusp of some breakthroughs in AI—not new algorithms or approaches, but new ways to use the algorithms we already have. But the more things change, the more they stay the same. Our ability to think about our responsibilities of ethics and justice—and, more specifically, to put&nbsp; in place mechanisms to redress harms caused by unfair decisions–are slow to catch up.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/kzdPxx3DXng\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Some of these are emerging topics and others are developments on existing concepts, but all of them will inform our thinking in the coming year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>MLOps FTW</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>MLOps attempts to bridge the gap between Machine Learning (ML) applications and the CI/CD pipelines that have become standard practice. ML presents a problem for CI/CD for several reasons. The data that powers ML applications is as important as code, making version control difficult; outputs are probabilistic rather than deterministic, making testing difficult; training a model is processor intensive and time consuming, making rapid build/deploy cycles difficult. None of these problems are unsolvable, but developing solutions will require substantial effort over the coming years.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>The Time Is Now to Adopt Responsible Machine Learning</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The era in which tech companies had a regulatory “free ride” has come to an end. Data use is no longer a “wild west” in which anything goes; there are legal and reputational consequences for using data improperly.&nbsp; Responsible Machine Learning (ML) is a movement to make AI systems accountable for the results they produce.&nbsp; Responsible ML includes explainable AI (systems that can explain why a decision was made), human-centered machine learning, regulatory compliance, ethics, interpretability, fairness, and building secure AI. Until now, corporate adoption of responsible ML has been lukewarm and reactive at best. In the next year, increased regulation (such as GDPR, CCPA), antitrust, and other legal forces will force companies to adopt responsible ML practices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>The Right Solution for Your Data: Cloud Data Lakes and Data Lakehouses</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data lakes have experienced a fairly robust resurgence over the last few years, specifically cloud data lakes. With more businesses migrating their data infrastructure to the cloud, as well as the increase of open source projects driving innovation in cloud data lakes, these will remain on the radar in 2021. Similarly, the data lakehouse, an architecture that features attributes of both the data lake and the data warehouse, gained traction in 2020 and will continue to grow in prominence in 2021. Cloud data warehouse engineering develops as a particular focus as database solutions move more and more to the cloud.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>A Wave of Cloud-Native, Distributed Data Frameworks</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Data science grew up with Hadoop and its vast ecosystem.&nbsp; Hadoop is now last decade’s news, and momentum has shifted to Spark, which now dominates the way Hadoop used to. But there are new challengers out there. New distributed computing frameworks like Ray and Dask are more flexible, and are cloud-native: they make it very simple to move workloads to the cloud.&nbsp; Both are seeing strong growth. What’s the next platform on the horizon?&nbsp; We’ll see in the coming year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Natural Language Processing Advances Significantly</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This year, the biggest story in AI was GPT-3, and its ability to generate almost human-sounding prose.&nbsp; What will that lead to in 2021? There are many possibilities, ranging from interactive assistants and automated customer service to automated fake news. Looking at GPT-3 more closely, here are the questions you should be asking. GPT-3 is being delivered via an API, not by incorporating the model directly into applications. Is “Language-as-a-service” the future? GPT-3 is great at creating English text, but has no concept of common sense or even facts; for example, it has recommended suicide as a cure for depression.&nbsp; Can more sophisticated language models overcome those limitations?&nbsp; GPT-3 reflects the biases and prejudices that are built into languages. How are those to be overcome, and is that the responsibility of the model or of the application developers?&nbsp; GPT-3 is the most exciting development to appear during the last year; in 2021, our attention will remain focused on it and its successors. We can’t help but be excited (and maybe a little scared) by GPT-4.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/teams.html\">O’Reilly’s online learning platform</a> can give your employees the resources they need to upskill and stay up to date on AI, data and hundreds of other technology and business topics. <a href=\"https://get.oreilly.com/ent_demo-request.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_campaign=techlead+global+nurture&amp;utm_content=em1+radar+overview\">Request a demo.</a></p>\\n</div></div>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/PNgA-4GmKv4\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>Change is the only constant in the technology world, and that’s particularly true in the realm of sysops, infrastructure, and security. Here’s a look ahead to 2021 and five of the trends we’re watching closely.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Kubernetes Complexity</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To say that Kubernetes is the leading container orchestration platform is an understatement.&nbsp; It’s the only container orchestration platform that counts. However, to say that Kubernetes is complex is also an understatement.&nbsp; The learning curve is both steep and long. How will developers address Kubernetes’ complexity? We are starting to see some simpler alternatives for specific use cases–for example, K3S for edge computing.&nbsp; Will that trend continue?&nbsp; Or will Kubernetes be subsumed into cloud providers’ management consoles in a way that simplifies the options available to developers (aka “opinionated”)? We don’t know, but we believe that an important trend for the next year will be attempts to simplify cloud orchestration.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Site Reliability and Observability</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The sea change in workplace dynamics brought about by Covid 19 has had a parallel effect on the world of site reliability engineering. Companies for whom an online presence was an afterthought are now finding it essential to survival. And they’re also finding it necessary to keep their online presence available 24&#215;7. So we foresee an increase in the demand for site reliability engineers–but beyond that, we expect an emphasis on the tools that SREs need. Look for a heavy emphasis on system observability and its fruits: high speed, actionable data allowing engineers to understand, prevent, and mitigate outages. Although it’s only part of the story, we’re particularly interested in OpenTelemetry, a vendor neutral standard for collecting system data. OpenTelementery promises an array of more refined and calibrated open source tools for observability in the years ahead.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>GitOps: The Future of DevOps</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For a decade or more, the slogan “Infrastructure as Code” has driven efforts to make configuration programmable. We’ve made lots of progress; and perhaps the best example of that progress is Kubernetes, which orchestrates the deployment, creation, and construction of containers. There’s one more piece (for now) to consider: how do you automate the configuration of Kubernetes itself? How do you make new deployments faster, while minimizing the possibility of human error at the same time? That’s achieved by using Git to manage Kubernetes’ configuration files and any other artifacts it needs to run. When anything changes, a Kubernetes operator manages the process of informing Kubernetes and related orchestration tools and gradually pushing the deployed system to the desired state. GitOps may be the ultimate expression of “Infrastructure as Code”; we expect it to have a big impact in the coming year.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Cyber Resilience</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Saying that cyber threats will increase, and that attacks will become more dangerous, hardly qualifies as a prediction or a trend. The sophisticated <a href=\"https://krebsonsecurity.com/2020/12/u-s-treasury-commerce-depts-hacked-through-solarwinds-compromise/\">cyber attacks</a> that compromised the U.S. Treasure, Commerce, and Homeland Security departments are, sadly, hardly surprising. What’s more important is how organizations respond to those threats. In the past, most companies have taken a reactive approach to security: address breaches as they happen, and if nothing happens, they’ve spent too much on security. That approach has failed time and time again. In the coming year, we expect companies to take a dynamic, holistic approach that strengthens their security posture. Steps towards resilience include having a robust Identity and Access Management policy by implementing zero trust, MFA, and passwordless authentication.&nbsp; Expect to see increased use of AI and Machine Learning (ML) by both good and bad actors. Bad actors will use AI to find and exploit new vulnerabilities (including vulnerabilities in AI systems themselves); security teams will use AI and ML tools to detect and block attacks, and to automate routine tasks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2><strong>Multi-cloud and Hybrid Clouds</strong></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s too easy to think of “the cloud” as a place: a single virtual location, with a single provider. But that’s not reality.&nbsp; As IBM has said frequently, the cloud is a capability, not a destination.&nbsp; By the time most companies start thinking seriously about a “cloud strategy,” they already have pilot projects in multiple clouds.&nbsp; Mergers and acquisitions complicate the situation even more, as does data that has to remain on-premises for regulatory or security reasons. What counts isn’t moving applications to a specific provider, but having a uniform interface that lets you use capabilities regardless of their physical location. 2021 will be the year that companies (officially) adopt multi- and hybrid clouds, removing the operational and developmental barriers between their own, on-premises IT and cloud providers. We will discover what it really means to be “cloud-native.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\\n\\n\\n\\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-very-light-gray-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\\n<p class=\"has-text-align-left has-small-font-size\"><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/online-learning/teams.html\">O’Reilly’s online learning platform</a> can give your employees the resources they need to upskill and stay up to date on Kubernetes, SRE, cybersecurity, cloud, and hundreds of other technology and business topics. <a href=\"https://get.oreilly.com/ent_demo-request.html?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=marketo&amp;utm_campaign=techlead+global+nurture&amp;utm_content=em1+radar+overview\">Request a demo.</a></p>\\n</div></div>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/7xc4nTkzPNs\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

The First Amendment to the US constitution says that the government can’t pass a law that restricts your speech. And neither Twitter nor Facebook are the US government, so whatever they do to block content isn’t a “free speech” issue, at least strictly interpreted.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Admittedly, that narrow view leaves out a lot. Both the right and the left can agree that we don’t really want Zuck or @jack determining what kinds of speech are legitimate. And most of us can agree that there’s a time when abstract principles have to give way to concrete realities, such as terrorists storming the US capitol building. That situation resulted from years of abusive speech that the social platforms had ignored, so that when the corporate power finally stepped in, their actions were too little, too late.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But as I said, the focus on “free speech” misframes the issue. The important issue here isn’t speech itself; it’s how and why speech is amplified—an amplification that can be used to drown out or intimidate other voices, or to selectively amplify voices for reasons that may be well-intended, self-interested, or even hostile to the public interest. The discussion we need, the discussion of amplification and its implications, has largely been supplanted by arguments about “free speech.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the Third Amendment, the US Constitution also guarantees a “free press.” A free press is important because the press has the power of replication: of taking speech and making it available more broadly. In the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries, that largely meant newspapers, which had the ability to reproduce tens of thousands of copies overnight. But freedom of the press has an important limitation. Anyone can talk, but to have freedom of the press you have to have a press–whether that’s a typewriter and a mimeograph, or all the infrastructure of a publisher like The New York TImes, CNN, or Fox News. And being a “press” has its own constraints: an editorial staff, an editorial policy, and so on. Because they’re in the business of replication, it’s probably more correct to think of Twitter and Facebook as exercising “press” functions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But what is the editorial function for Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and most other social media platforms? There isn’t an editor who decides whether your writing is insightful. There’s no editorial viewpoint. There’s only the shallowest attempt to verify facts. The editorial function is driven entirely by the desire to increase engagement, and this is done algorithmically. And what algorithms have “learned” perhaps isn’t surprising: showing people content that makes them angry is the best way to keep them coming back for more. And the more they come back, the more ads are clicked, and the more income flows in. Over the past few years, that editorial strategy has certainly played into the hands of the alt-right and neo-Nazi groups, who learned quickly how to take advantage of it. Nor have left-leaning polemicists missed the opportunity. The battle of overheated rhetoric has cheapened the public discourse and made consensus almost unattainable. Indeed, it has made attention itself unattainable: and, as Peter Wang has <a href=\"https://medium.com/@pwang/52253dbfe627\">argued</a>, scarcity of attention–particularly the “synchronous attention of a group”–is the biggest problem we face, because it rules out thoughtful consensus.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Again, that’s been discussed many times over the past few years, but we seem to have lost that thread. We’ve had reproduction—we’ve had a press—but with the worst possible kind of editorial values. There are plenty of discussions of journalistic values and ethics that might be appropriate; but an editorial policy that has no other value than increasing engagement doesn’t even pass the lowest bar. And that editorial policy has left the user communities of Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and other media vulnerable to <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/defusing-propaganda-feedback-loops-on-the-social-web/\">deafening feedback loops</a>. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Social media feedback loops can be manipulated in many ways: by automated systems that reply or “like” certain kinds of content, as well as by individual users who can also reply and “like” by the thousands.&nbsp; And those loops are aided by the platforms’ recommendation systems: either by recommending specific inflammatory posts, or by recommending that users join specific groups. An internal Facebook report showed that, by their own reckoning, 70% of all “civic” groups on Facebook contained “<a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/70-of-top-civic-facebook-groups-are-toxic-or-violent-report-finds/\">hate speech, misinformation, violent rhetoric, or other toxic behavior</a>”; and the company has been aware of that since 2016.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So where are we left?&nbsp; I would rather not have Zuck and @jack determine what kinds of speech are acceptable. That’s not the editorial policy we want.&nbsp; And we certainly need protections for people saying unpopular things on social media; eliminating those protections cuts both ways. What needs to be controlled is different altogether: it’s the optimization function that maximizes engagement, measured by time spent on the platform. And we do want to hold Zuck and @jack responsible for that optimization function, just as we want the publisher of a newspaper or a television news channel to be responsible for the headlines they write and what they put on their front page. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Simply stripping Section 230 protection strikes me as irrelevant to dealing with what Shoshana Zuboff terms an “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/29/opinion/sunday/facebook-surveillance-society-technology.html\">epistemic coup</a>.” Is the right solution to do away with algorithmic engagement enhancement entirely?&nbsp; Facebook’s decision to <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-groups/facebook-says-it-will-permanently-stop-recommending-political-groups-to-users-idUSKBN29X00C\">stop recommending political groups to users</a> is a step forward. But they need to go much farther in stripping algorithmic enhancement from their platform. Detecting bots would be a start; a better algorithm for “engagement,” one that promotes well-being rather than anger, would be a great ending point. As Apple CEO Tim Cook, clearly thinking about Facebook, recently <a href=\"https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/tim-cook-may-have-just-ended-facebook.html\">said</a>, &#8220;A social dilemma cannot be allowed to become a social catastrophe&#8230;We believe that ethical technology is technology that works for you… It&#8217;s technology that helps you sleep, not keeps you up. It tells you when you&#8217;ve had enough. It gives you space to create or draw or write or learn, not refresh just one more time.&#8221;&nbsp; This reflects Apple’s values rather than Facebook’s (and one would do well to reflect on Facebook’s origins at Harvard); but it is leading towards the right question.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Making people angry might increase shareholder value short-term. But that probably isn’t a sustainable business; and if it is, it’s a business that does incredible social damage. The “solution” isn’t likely to be legislation; I can’t imagine laws that regulate algorithms effectively, and that can&#8217;t be gamed by people who are willing to work hard to game them. I guarantee that those people are out there. We can’t say that the solution is to “be better people,” because there are plenty of people who don’t want to be better; just look at the reaction to the pandemic. Just look at the frustration of the many Facebook and Twitter employees who realized that the time to lay aside abstract principles like “free speech” was long before the election. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We could perhaps return to the original idea of “incorporation,” when incorporation <a href=\"https://www.directorsandboards.com/articles/singlepurpose-debate-social-good-uprooted\">meant</a> a “body created by law for the purpose of attaining public ends through an appeal to private interests”–one of Zuboff’s solutions is to “tie data collection to fundamental rights and data use to public services.” However, that would require legal bodies that made tough decisions about whether corporations were indeed working towards “public ends.”&nbsp; As Zuboff points out earlier in her article, it’s easy to look to antitrust, but the Sherman Antitrust Act was largely a failure.&nbsp; Would courts ruling on “public ends” be any different?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In the end, we will get the social media we deserve. And that leads to the right question. How do we build social media that maintains social good, rather than destroying it?&nbsp; What kinds of business models are needed to support that kind of social good, rather than merely maximizing shareholder value?</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/NsfBPf08fpI\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

All too often, trends degenerate into horse races over languages and platforms. Look at all the angst heating up social media when TIOBE or RedMonk releases their reports on language rankings. Those reports are valuable, but their value isn’t in knowing what languages are popular in any given month. And that’s what I’d like to get to here: the real trends that aren’t reflected (or at best, are indirectly reflected) by the horse races. Sometimes they’re only apparent if you look carefully at the data; sometimes it’s just a matter of keeping your ear to the ground.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In either case, there’s a difference between “trends” and “trendy.” Trendy, fashionable things are often a flash in the pan, forgotten or regretted a year or two later (like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pet_Rock\">Pet Rocks</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chia_Pet\">Chia Pets</a>). Real trends unfold on much longer time scales and may take several steps backward during the process: civil rights, for example. Something is happening and, over the long arc of history, it’s not going to stop. In our industry, cloud computing might be a good example.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Methodology</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This study is based on title usage on O’Reilly online learning. The data includes all usage of our platform, not just content that O’Reilly has published, and certainly not just books. We’ve explored usage across all publishing partners and learning modes, from live training courses and online events to interactive functionality provided by Katacoda and Jupyter notebooks. We’ve included search data in the graphs, although we have avoided using search data in our analysis. Search data is distorted by how quickly customers find what they want: if they don’t succeed, they may try a similar search with many of the same terms. (But don’t even think of searching for R or C!) Usage data shows what content our members actually use, though we admit it has its own problems: usage is biased by the content that’s available, and there’s no data for topics that are so new that content hasn’t been developed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We haven’t combined data from multiple terms. Because we’re doing simple pattern matching against titles, usage for “AWS security” is a subset of the usage for “security.” We made a (very) few exceptions, usually when there are two different ways to search for the same concept. For example, we combined “SRE” with “site reliability engineering,” and “object oriented” with “object-oriented.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The results are, of course, biased by the makeup of the user population of O’Reilly online learning itself. Our members are a mix of individuals (professionals, students, hobbyists) and corporate users (employees of a company with a corporate account). We suspect that the latter group is somewhat more conservative than the former. In practice, this means that we may have less meaningful data on the latest JavaScript frameworks or the newest programming languages. New frameworks appear every day (literally), and our corporate clients won’t suddenly tell their staff to reimplement the ecommerce site just because last year’s hot framework is no longer fashionable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Usage and query data for each group are normalized to the highest value in each group. Practically, this means that you can compare topics within a group, but you can’t compare the groups with each other. Year-over-year (YOY) growth compares January through September 2020 with the same months of 2019. Small fluctuations (under 5% or so) are likely to be noise rather than a sign of a real trend.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Enough preliminaries. Let’s look at the data, starting at the highest level: O’Reilly online learning itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>O’Reilly Online Learning</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Usage of O’Reilly online learning grew steadily in 2020, with 24% growth since 2019. That may not be surprising, given the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting changes in the technology industry. Companies that once resisted working from home were suddenly shutting down their offices and asking their staff to work remotely. Many have said that remote work will remain an option indefinitely. COVID had a significant effect on training: in-person training (whether on- or off-site) was no longer an option, so organizations of all sizes increased their participation in live online training, which grew by 96%. More traditional modes also saw increases: usage of books increased by 11%, while videos were up 24%. We also added two new learning modes, Katacoda scenarios and Jupyter notebooks, during the year; we don’t yet have enough data to see how they’re trending. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to place our growth data in this context. We frequently say that 10% growth in a topic is “healthy,” and we’ll stand by that, but remember that O’Reilly online learning itself showed 24% growth. So while a technology whose usage is growing 10% annually is healthy, it’s not keeping up with the platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As travel ground to a halt, so did traditional in-person conferences. We closed our conference business in March, replacing it with live virtual Superstreams. While we can’t compare in-person conference data with virtual event data, we can make a few observations. The most successful superstream series focused on <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/software-architecture-superstream-series/0636920444961/\">software architecture</a> and <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/oreilly-infrastructure-ops-superstream-series/0636920410027/\">infrastructure and operations</a>. Why? The in-person O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference was small but growing. But when the pandemic hit, companies found out that they really were online businesses—and if they weren’t, they had to become online to survive. Even small restaurants and farm markets were adding online ordering features to their websites. Suddenly, the ability to design, build, and operate applications at scale wasn’t optional; it was necessary for survival. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Programming Languages</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although we’re not fans of the language horse race, programming languages are as good a place as any to start. Figure 1 shows usage, year-over-year growth in usage, and the number of search queries for several popular languages. The top languages for O’Reilly online learning are Python (up 27%), Java (down 3%), C++ (up 10%), C (up 12%), and JavaScript (up 40%). Looking at 2020 usage rather than year-over-year changes, it’s surprising to see JavaScript so far behind Python and Java. (JavaScript usage is 20% of Python’s, and 33% of Java’s.) </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Past the top five languages, we see healthy growth in Go (16%) and Rust (94%). Although we believe that Rust’s popularity will continue to grow, don’t get too excited; it’s easy to grow 94% when you’re starting from a small base. Go has clearly established itself, particularly as a language for concurrent programming, and Rust is likely to establish itself for “system programming”: building new operating systems and tooling for cloud operations. Julia, a language designed for mathematical computation, is an interesting wild card. It’s slightly down over the past year, but we’re optimistic about its long term chances.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13620\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-1-1048x748.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 1. Programming languages</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We shouldn’t separate usage of titles specifically aimed at learning a programming language from titles applying the language or using frameworks based on it. After all, many Java developers use Spring, and searching for “Java” misses content only has the word “Spring” in the title. The same is true for JavaScript, with the React, Angular, and Node.js frameworks. With Python, the most heavily used libraries are PyTorch and scikit-learn. Figure 2 shows what happens when you add the use of content about Python, Java, and JavaScript to the most important frameworks for those languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13621\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-2-1048x758.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 2. Programming languages and frameworks combined</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It probably isn’t a surprise that the results are similar, but there are some key differences. Adding usage and search query data for Spring (up 7%) reverses Java’s apparent decline (net-zero growth). Zero growth isn’t inappropriate for an established enterprise language, particularly one owned by a company that has mired the language in controversy. Looking further at JavaScript, if you add in usage for the most popular frameworks (React, Angular, and Node.js), JavaScript usage on O’Reilly online learning rises to 50% of Python’s, only slightly behind Java and its frameworks. However, Python, when added to the heavily used frameworks PyTorch and scikit-learn, remains the clear leader.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important to understand what we’ve done though. We’re trying to build a more comprehensive picture of language use that includes the use of various frameworks. We’re not pretending the frameworks themselves are comparable—Spring is primarily for backend and middleware development (though it includes a web framework); React and Angular are for frontend development; and scikit-learn and PyTorch are machine learning libraries. And although it’s widely used, we didn’t assign TensorFlow to any language; it has bindings for Python, Java, C++, and JavaScript, and it’s not clear which language predominates. (Google Trends suggests C++.) We also ignored thousands (literally) of minor platforms, frameworks, and libraries for all these languages; once you get past the top few, you’re into the noise.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We aren’t advocating for Python, Java, or any other language. None of these top languages are going away, though their stock may rise or fall as fashions change and the software industry evolves. We’re just saying that when you make comparisons, you have to be careful about exactly what you’re comparing. The horse race? That’s just what it is. Fun to watch, and have a mint julep when it’s over, but don’t bet your savings (or your job) on it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If the horse race isn’t significant, just what <em>are </em>the important trends for programming languages? We see several factors changing pro‐ gramming in significant ways:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><em>Multiparadigm languages</em><br />Since last year, O’Reilly online learning has seen a 14% increase in the use of content on functional programming. However, Haskell and Erlang, the classic functional languages, aren’t where the action is; neither shows significant usage, and both are headed down (roughly 20% decline year over year). Object oriented programming is up even more than functional programming: 29% growth since last year. This suggests that the real story is the integration of functional features into procedural and object-oriented languages. Starting with Python 3.0 in 2008 and continuing with Java 8 in 2014, programming languages have added higher-order functions (lambdas) and other “functional” features. Several popular languages (including JavaScript and Go) have had functional features from the beginning. This trend started over 20 years ago (with the Standard Template Library for C++), and we expect it to continue.<br /></li><li><em>Concurrent programming</em><br />Platform data for concurrency shows an 8% year-over-year increase. This isn’t a large number, but don’t miss the story because the numbers are small. Java was the first widely used language to support concurrency as part of the language. In the mid-’90s, thread support was a luxury; Moore’s law had plenty of room to grow. That’s no longer the case, and support for concurrency, like support for functional programming, has become table stakes. Go, Rust, and most other modern languages have built-in support for concurrency. Concurrency has always been one of Python’s weaknesses.<br /></li><li><em>Dynamic versus static typing </em><br />This is another important paradigmatic axis. The distinction between languages with dynamic typing (like Ruby and JavaScript) and statically typed languages (like Java and Go) is arguably more important than the distinction between functional and object-oriented languages. Not long ago, the idea of adding static typing to dynamic languages would have started a brawl. No longer. Combining paradigms to form a hybrid is taking a hold here too. Python 3.5 added type hinting, and more recent versions have added additional static typing features. TypeScript, which adds static typing to JavaScript, is coming into its own (12% year-over-year increase).<br /></li><li><em>Low-code and no-code computing</em><br />It’s hard for a learning platform to gather data about a trend that minimizes the need to learn, but low-code is real and is bound to have an effect. Spreadsheets were the forerunner of low-code computing. When VisiCalc was first released in 1979, it enabled millions to do significant and important computation without learning a programming language. Democratization is an important trend in many areas of technology; it would be surprising if programming were any different. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What’s important isn’t the horse race so much as the features that languages are acquiring, and why. Given that we’ve run to the end of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law\">Moore’s law</a>, concurrency will be central to the future of programming. We can’t just get faster processors. We’ll be working with microservices and serverless/functions-as-a-service in the cloud for a long time–and these are inherently concurrent systems. Functional programming doesn’t solve the problem of concurrency—but the discipline of immutability certainly helps avoid pitfalls. (And who doesn’t love first-class functions?) As software projects inevitably become larger and more complex, it makes eminent sense for languages to extend themselves by mixing in functional features. We need programmers who are thinking about how to use functional and object-oriented features together; what practices and patterns make sense when building enterprise-scale concurrent software?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Low-code and no-code programming will inevitably change the nature of programming and programming languages:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>There will be new languages, new libraries, and new tools to support no- or low-code programmers. They’ll be very simple. (Horrors, will they look like BASIC? Please no.) Whatever form they take, it will take programmers to build and maintain them.<br /></li><li>We’ll certainly see sophisticated computer-aided coding as an aid to experienced programmers. Whether that means &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/pair-programming-with-ai/\">pair programming with a machine</a>&#8221; or algorithms that can write <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/automated-coding-and-the-future-of-programming/\">simple programs on their own</a> remains to be seen. These tools won’t eliminate programmers; they’ll make programmers more productive.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There will be a predictable <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/databases-coding-real-programming-myth/\">backlash against letting the great unwashed</a> into the programmers’ domain. Ignore it. Low-code is part of a democratization movement that puts the power of computing into more peoples’ hands, and that’s almost always a good thing. Programmers who realize what this movement means won’t be put out of jobs by nonprogrammers. They’ll be the ones becoming more productive and writing the tools that others will use.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Whether you’re a technology leader or a new programmer, pay attention to these slow, long-term trends. They’re the ones that will change the face of our industry. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Operations or DevOps or SRE</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The science (or art) of IT operations has changed radically in the last decade. There’s been a lot of discussion about operations culture (the movement frequently known as DevOps), continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), and site reliability engineering (SRE). Cloud computing has replaced data centers, colocation facilities, and in-house machine rooms. Containers allow much closer integration between developers and operations and do a lot to standardize deployment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Operations isn’t going away; there’s no such thing as <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2012/06/what-is-devops.html\">NoOps</a>. Technologies like Function as a Service (a.k.a. FaaS, a.k.a. serverless, a.k.a. AWS Lambda) only change the nature of the beast. The number of people needed to manage an infrastructure of a given size has shrunk, but the infrastructures we’re building have expanded, sometimes by orders of magnitude. It’s easy to round up tens of thousands of nodes to train or deploy a complex AI application. Even if those machines are all in Amazon’s giant data centers and managed in bulk using highly automated tools, operations staff still need to keep systems running smoothly, monitoring, troubleshooting, and ensuring that you’re not <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/is-cloud-waste-inevitable-as-companies-move-to-the-cloud/\">paying for resources you don’t need</a>. Serverless and other cloud technologies allow the same operations team to manage much larger infrastructures; they don’t make operations go away.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The terminology used to describe this job fluctuates, but we don’t see any real changes. The term “DevOps” has fallen on hard times. Usage of DevOps-titled content in O’Reilly online learning has dropped by 17% in the past year, while SRE (including “site reliability engineering”) has climbed by 37%, and the term “operations” is up 25%. While SRE and DevOps are distinct concepts, for many customers SRE is DevOps at Google scale–and who doesn’t want that kind of growth? Both SRE and DevOps emphasize similar practices: version control (62% growth for GitHub, and 48% for Git), testing (high usage, though no year-over-year growth), continuous deployment (down 20%), monitoring (up 9%), and observability (up 128%). <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terraform_(software)\">Terraform</a>, HashiCorp’s open source tool for automating the configuration of cloud infrastructure, also shows strong (53%) growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13622\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-3-1048x788.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 3. Operations, DevOps, and SRE </em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s more interesting to look at the story the data tells about the tools. Docker is close to flat (5% decline year over year), but usage of content about containers skyrocketed by 99%. So yes, containerization is clearly a big deal. Docker itself may have stalled—we’ll know more next year—but Kubernetes’s dominance as the tool for container orchestration keeps containers central. Docker was the enabling technology, but Kubernetes made it possible to deploy containers at scale.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Kubernetes itself is the other superstar, with 47% growth, along with the highest usage (and the most search queries) in this group. Kubernetes isn’t just an orchestration tool; it’s the <a href=\"https://www.itproportal.com/features/kubernetes-as-a-cloud-native-operating-system/\">cloud’s operating system</a> (or, as Kelsey Hightower has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/kelseyhightower/status/775487754868133888\">said</a>, “Kubernetes will be the Linux of distributed systems”). But the data doesn’t show the number of conversations we’ve had with people who think that Kubernetes is just “too complex.” We see three possible solutions:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>A “simplified” version of Kubernetes that isn’t as flexible, but trades off a lot of the complexity. <a href=\"https://k3s.io/\">K3s</a> is a possible step in this direction. The question is, What’s the trade-off? Here’s my version of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">Pareto principle</a>, also known as the 80/20 rule. Given any system (like Kubernetes), it’s usually possible to build something simpler by keeping the most widely used 80% of the features and cutting the other 20%. And some applications will fit within the 80% of the features that were kept. But most applications (maybe 80% of them?) will require at least one of the features that were sacrificed to make the system simpler.<br /></li><li>An entirely new approach, some tool that isn’t yet on the horizon. We have no idea what that tool is. In Yeats’s words, “What rough beast&#8230;slouches towards Bethlehem to be born”? <br /></li><li>An integrated solution from a cloud vendor (for example, Microsoft’s open source <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/the-dapr-distributed-runtime-nears-production-readiness/\">Dapr distributed runtime</a>). I don’t mean cloud vendors that provide Kubernetes as a service; we already have those. What if the cloud vendors integrate Kubernetes’s functionality into their stack in such a way that that functionality disappears into some kind of management console? Then the question becomes, What features do you lose, and do you need them? And what kind of vendor lock-in games do you want to play? </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rich ecosystem of tools surrounding Kubernetes (Istio, Helm, and others) shows how valuable it is. But where do we go from here? Even if Kubernetes is the right tool to manage the complexity of modern applications that run in the cloud, the desire for simpler solutions will eventually lead to higher-level abstractions. Will they be adequate?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/observability-a-3-year-retrospective/\">Observability</a> saw the greatest growth in the past year (128%), while monitoring is only up 9%. While observability is a richer, more powerful capability than monitoring—observability is the ability to find the information you need to analyze or debug software, while monitoring requires predicting in advance what data will be useful—we suspect that this shift is largely cosmetic. “Observability” risks becoming the new name for monitoring. And that’s <a href=\"https://www.honeycomb.io/blog/observability-whats-in-a-name/\">unfortunate</a>. If you think observability is merely a more fashionable term for monitoring, you’re missing its value. Complex systems running in the cloud will need true observability to be manageable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Infrastructure is code, and we’ve seen plenty of tools for automating configuration. But Chef and Puppet, two leaders in this movement, are both significantly down (49% and 40% respectively), as is Salt. Ansible is the only tool from this group that’s up (34%). Two trends are responsible for this. Ansible appears to have supplanted Chef and Puppet, possibly because Ansible is multilingual, while Chef and Puppet are tied to Ruby. Second, Docker and Kubernetes have changed the configuration game. Our data shows that Chef and Puppet peaked in 2017, when Kubernetes started an almost exponential growth spurt, as Figure 4 shows. (Each curve is normalized separately to 1; we wanted to emphasize the inflection points rather than compare usage.) Containerized deployment appears to minimize the problem of reproducible configuration, since a container is a complete software package. You have a container; you can deploy it many times, getting the same result each time. In reality, it’s never that simple, but it certainly looks that simple–and that apparent simplicity reduces the need for tools like Chef and Puppet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13623\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-4-1048x782.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 4. Docker and Kubernetes versus Chef and Puppet</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The biggest challenge facing operations teams in the coming year, and the biggest challenge facing data engineers, will be learning how to deploy AI systems effectively. In the past decade, a lot of ideas and technologies have come out of the DevOps movement: the source repository as the single source of truth, rapid automated deployment, constant testing, and more. They’ve been very effective, but AI breaks the assumptions that lie behind them, and deployment is frequently the greatest barrier to AI success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI breaks these assumptions because data is more important than code. We don’t yet have adequate tools for versioning data (though <a href=\"https://dvc.org/\">DVC</a> is a start). Models are neither code nor data, and we don’t have adequate tools for versioning models either (though tools like <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a> are a start). Frequent deployment assumes that the software can be built relatively quickly, but training a model can take days. It’s been suggested that model training doesn’t need to be part of the build process, but that’s really the most important part of the application. Testing is critical to continuous deployment, but the behavior of AI systems is probabilistic, not deterministic, so it’s harder to say that this test or that test failed. It’s particularly difficult if testing includes issues like fairness and bias.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although there is a nascent <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MLOps\">MLOps</a> movement, our data doesn’t show that people are using (or searching for) content in these areas in significant numbers. Usage is easily explainable; in many of these areas, content doesn’t exist yet. But users will search for content whether or not it exists, so the small number of searches shows that most of our users aren’t yet aware of the problem. Operations staff too frequently assume that an AI system is just another application—but they’re wrong. And AI developers too frequently assume that an operations team will be able to deploy their software, and they’ll be able to move on to the next project—but they’re also wrong. This situation is a train wreck in slow motion, and the big question is whether we can stop the trains before they crash. These problems will be solved eventually, with a new generation of tools—indeed, those tools are already being built—but we’re not there yet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>AI, Machine Learning, and Data</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Healthy growth in artificial intelligence has continued: machine learning is up 14%, while AI is up 64%; data science is up 16%, and statistics is up 47%. While AI and machine learning are distinct concepts, there’s enough confusion about definitions that they’re frequently used interchangeably. We informally define machine learning as “the part of AI that works”; AI itself is more research oriented and aspirational. If you accept that definition, it’s not surprising that content about machine learning has seen the heaviest usage: it’s about taking research out of the lab and putting it into practice. It’s also not surprising that we see solid growth for AI, because that’s where bleeding-edge engineers are looking for new ideas to turn into machine learning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13624\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-5-1048x760.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 5. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Have the skepticism, fear, and criticism surrounding AI taken a toll, or are “reports of AI’s death greatly exaggerated”? We don’t see that in our data, though there are certainly some metrics to say that <a href=\"https://science.sciencemag.org/content/368/6494/927\">artificial intelligence has stalled</a>. Many projects never make it to production, and while the last year has seen amazing progress in natural language processing (up 21%), such as OpenAI’s GPT-3, we’re seeing fewer spectacular results like winning Go games. It’s possible that AI (along with machine learning, data, big data, and all their fellow travelers) is descending into the trough of the hype cycle. We don’t think so, but we’re prepared to be wrong. As <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/benlorica/\">Ben Lorica</a> has said (in conversation), many years of work will be needed to bring current research into commercial products.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s certainly true that there’s been a (deserved) backlash over heavy handed use of AI. A backlash is only to be expected when deep learning applications are used to justify <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/06/24/882683463/the-computer-got-it-wrong-how-facial-recognition-led-to-a-false-arrest-in-michig\">arresting the wrong people</a>, and when some police departments are comfortable using software with a <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17535814/uk-face-recognition-police-london-accuracy-completely-comfortable\">98% false positive rate</a>. A backlash is only to be expected when software systems designed to maximize “engagement” end up spreading misinformation and conspiracy theories. A backlash is only to be expected when software developers don’t take into account issues of power and abuse. And a backlash is only to be expected when too many executives see AI as a “magic sauce” that will turn their organization around without pain or, frankly, a whole lot of work.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But we don’t think those issues, as important as they are, say a lot about the future of AI. The future of AI is less about breathtaking breakthroughs and creepy face or voice recognition than it is about small, mundane applications. Think quality control in a factory; think intelligent search <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/answers/search/\">on O’Reilly online learning</a>; think <a href=\"https://www.dpreview.com/news/5756257699/nvidia-research-develops-a-neural-network-to-replace-traditional-video-compression\">optimizing data compression</a>; think <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/10/16/1010617/ai-image-recognition-construction-computer-vision-costs-delays/\">tracking progress on a construction site</a>. I’ve seen too many articles saying that AI hasn’t helped in the struggle against COVID, as if someone was going to click a button on their MacBook and a superdrug was going to pop out of a USB-C port. (And AI has played a huge role in <a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/artificial-intelligence/medical-ai/what-ai-can-and-cant-do-in-the-race-for-a-coronavirus-vaccine\">COVID vaccine development</a>.) AI is playing an important supporting role—and that’s exactly the role we should expect. It’s enabling researchers to navigate tens of thousands of research papers and reports, design drugs and engineer genes that might work, and <a href=\"https://theconversation.com/teaching-computers-to-read-health-records-is-helping-fight-covid-19-heres-how-147385\">analyze millions of health records</a>. Without automating these tasks, getting to the end of the pandemic will be impossible.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So here’s the future we see for AI and machine learning:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Natural language has been (and will continue to be) a big deal. GPT-3 has changed the world. We’ll see AI being used to create “fake news,” and we’ll find that AI gives us the best tools for detecting what’s fake and what isn’t.<br /></li><li>Many companies are placing significant bets on using AI to automate customer service. We’ve made great strides in our ability to synthesize speech, generate realistic answers, and search for solutions.<br /></li><li>We’ll see lots of tiny, embedded AI systems in everything from medical sensors to appliances to factory floors. Anyone interested in the future of technology should watch <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/tinyml/9781492052036/\">Pete Warden’s work on TinyML</a> very carefully.<br /></li><li>We still haven’t faced squarely the issue of user interfaces for collaboration between humans and AI. We don’t want AI oracles that just replace human errors with machine-generated errors at scale; we want the ability to collaborate with AI to produce results better than either humans or machines could alone. Researchers are <a href=\"http://jessylin.com/2020/06/08/rethinking-human-ai-interaction/\">starting to catch on</a>.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>TensorFlow is the leader among machine learning platforms; it gets the most searches, while usage has stabilized at 6% growth. Content about scikit-learn, Python’s machine learning library, is used almost as heavily, with 11% year-over-year growth. PyTorch is in third place (yes, this is a horse race), but usage of PyTorch content has gone up 159% year over year. That increase is no doubt influenced by the popularity of Jeremy Howard’s <a href=\"https://course.fast.ai/\">Practical Deep Learning for Coders</a> course and the PyTorch-based fastai library (no data for 2019). It also appears that PyTorch is more popular among researchers, while TensorFlow remains dominant in production. But as Jeremy’s students move into industry, and as researchers migrate toward production positions, we expect to see the balance between PyTorch and TensorFlow shift. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://kafka.apache.org/\">Kafka</a> is a crucial tool for building data pipelines; it’s stable, with 6% growth and usage similar to Spark. Pulsar, Kafka’s “next generation” competition, isn’t yet on the map.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Tools for automating AI and machine learning development (IBM’s <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/cloud/watson-studio/autoai\">AutoAI</a>, Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/automl\">Cloud AutoML</a>, Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/automl/\">AutoML</a>, and Amazon’s <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">SageMaker</a>) have gotten a lot of press attention in the past year, but we don’t see any signs that they’re making a significant dent in the market. That content usage is nonexistent isn’t a surprise; O’Reilly members can’t use content that doesn’t exist. But our members aren’t searching for these topics either. It may be that AutoAI is relatively new or that users don’t think they need to search for supplementary training material.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What about data science? The report <em>What Is Data Science </em>is a decade old, but surprisingly for a 10-year-old paper, views are up 142% over 2019. The tooling has changed though. Hadoop was at the center of the data science world a decade ago. It’s still around, but now it’s a legacy system, with a 23% decline since 2019. Spark is now the dominant data platform, and it’s certainly the tool engineers want to learn about: usage of Spark content is about three times that of Hadoop. But even Spark is down 11% since last year. <a href=\"https://ray.io/\">Ray</a>, a newcomer that promises to make it easier to build distributed applications, doesn’t yet show usage to match Spark (or even Hadoop), but it does show 189% growth. And there are other tools on the horizon: <a href=\"https://dask.org/\">Dask</a> has seen nearly 400% growth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s been exciting to watch the discussion of data ethics and activism in the past year. Broader societal movements (such as #BlackLivesMatter), along with increased industry awareness of diversity and inclusion, have made it more difficult to ignore issues like fairness, power, and transparency. What’s sad is that our data shows little evidence that this is more than a discussion. Usage of general content (not specific to AI and ML) about diversity and inclusion is up significantly (87%), but the absolute numbers are still small. Topics like ethics, fairness, transparency, and explainability don’t make a dent in our data. That may be because few books have been published and few training courses have been offered—but that’s a problem in itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Web Development</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since the invention of HTML in the early 1990s, the first web servers, and the first browsers, the web has exploded (or degenerated) into a proliferation of platforms. Those platforms make web development infinitely more flexible: They make it possible to support a host of devices and screen sizes. They make it possible to build sophisticated applications that run in the browser. And with every new year, “desktop” applications look more old-fashioned.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what does the world of web frameworks look like? React leads in usage of content and also shows significant growth (34% year over year). Despite rumors that Angular is fading, it’s the #2 platform, with 10% growth. And usage of content about the server-side platform Node.js is just behind Angular, with 15% growth. None of this is surprising.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s more surprising that Ruby on Rails shows extremely strong growth (77% year over year) after several years of moderate, stable performance. Likewise, Django (which appeared at roughly the same time as Rails) shows both heavy usage and 63% growth. You might wonder whether this growth holds for all older platforms; it doesn’t. Usage of content about PHP is relatively low and declining (8% drop), even though it’s still used by <a href=\"https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/pl-php\">almost 80%</a> of all websites. (It will be interesting to see how <a href=\"https://www.php.net/archive/2020.php\">PHP 8</a> changes the picture.) And while jQuery shows healthy 18% growth, usage of jQuery content was lower than any other platform we looked at. (Keep in mind, though, that there are literally thousands of web platforms. A complete study would be either heroic or foolish. Or both.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://vuejs.org/\">Vue</a> and <a href=\"https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/\">Flask</a> make surprisingly weak showings: for both platforms, content usage is about one-eighth of React’s. Usage of Vue-related content declined 13% in the past year, while Flask grew 10%. Neither is challenging the dominant players. It’s tempting to think of Flask and Vue as “new” platforms, but they were released in 2010 and 2014, respectively; they’ve had time to establish themselves. Two of the most promising new platforms, <a href=\"https://svelte.dev/\">Svelte</a> and <a href=\"https://nextjs.org/\">Next.js</a>, don’t yet produce enough data to chart—possibly because there isn’t yet much content to use. Likewise, <a href=\"https://webassembly.org/\">WebAssembly</a> (Wasm) doesn’t show up. (It’s also too new, with little content or training material available.) But WebAssembly represents a major rethinking of web programming and bears watching closely. Could WebAssembly turn JavaScript’s dominance of web development on its head? We suspect that nothing will happen quickly. Enterprise customers will be reluctant to bear the cost of moving from an older framework like PHP to a more fashionable JavaScript framework. It costs little to stick with an old stalwart.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13625\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-6-1048x761.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 6. Web development</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The foundational technologies HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all showing healthy growth in usage (22%, 46%, and 40%, respectively), though they’re behind the leading frameworks. We’ve already noted that JavaScript is one of the top programming languages—and the modern web platforms are nothing if not the apotheosis of JavaScript. We find that chilling. The original vision for the World Wide Web was radically empowering and democratizing. You didn’t need to be a techno-geek; you didn’t even need to program—you could just click “view source” in the browser and copy bits you liked from other sites. Twenty-five years later, that’s no longer true: you can still “view source,” but all you’ll see is a lot of incomprehensible JavaScript. Ironically, just as other technologies are democratizing, web development is increasingly the domain of programmers. Will that trend be reversed by a new generation of platforms, or by a reformulation of the web itself? We shall see.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Clouds of All Kinds</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s no surprise that the cloud is growing rapidly. Usage of content about the cloud is up 41% since last year. Usage of cloud titles that don’t mention a specific vendor (e.g., Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud) grew at an even faster rate (46%). Our customers don’t see the cloud through the lens of any single platform. We’re only at the beginning of cloud adoption; while <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/cloud-adoption-in-2020/\">most companies</a> are using cloud services in some form, and many have moved significant business-critical applications and datasets to the cloud, we have a long way to go. If there’s one technology trend you need to be on top of, this is it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The horse race between the leading cloud vendors, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, doesn’t present any surprises. Amazon is winning, even ahead of the generic “cloud”—but Microsoft and Google are catching up, and Amazon’s growth has stalled (only 5%). Use of content about Azure shows 136% growth—more than any of the competitors—while Google Cloud’s 84% growth is hardly shabby. When you dominate a market the way AWS dominates the cloud, there’s nowhere to go but down. But with the growth that Azure and Google Cloud are showing, Amazon’s dominance could be short-lived.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What’s behind this story? Microsoft has done an excellent job of reinventing itself as a cloud company. In the past decade, it’s rethought every aspect of its business: Microsoft has become a leader in open source; it owns GitHub; it owns LinkedIn. It’s hard to think of any corporate transformation so radical. This clearly isn’t the Microsoft that declared Linux a “cancer,” and that Microsoft could never have succeeded with Azure.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Google faces a different set of problems. Twelve years ago, the company arguably delivered serverless with App Engine. It open sourced Kubernetes and bet very heavily on its leadership in AI, with the leading AI platform TensorFlow highly optimized to run on Google hardware. So why is it in third place? Google’s problem hasn’t been its ability to deliver leading-edge technology but rather its ability to reach customers—a problem that Thomas Kurian, Google Cloud’s CEO, is <a href=\"https://www.crn.com/news/cloud/how-thomas-kurian-s-quite-simple-strategy-is-transforming-google-cloud\">attempting to address</a>. Ironically, part of Google’s customer problem is its focus on engineering to the detriment of the customers themselves. Any number of people have told us that they stay away from Google because they’re too likely to say, “Oh, that service you rely on? We’re shutting it down; we have a better solution.” Amazon and Microsoft don’t do that; they understand that a cloud provider has to support legacy software, and that all software is legacy the moment it’s released.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13626\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-7-1048x776.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 7. Cloud usage </em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While our data shows very strong growth (41%) in usage for content about the cloud, it doesn’t show significant usage for terms like “multicloud” and “hybrid cloud” or for specific hybrid cloud products like Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/anthos\">Anthos</a> or Microsoft’s <a href=\"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/azure-arc/\">Azure Arc</a>. These are new products, for which little content exists, so low usage isn’t surprising. But the usage of specific cloud technologies isn’t that important in this context; what’s more important is that usage of all the cloud platforms is growing, particularly content that isn’t tied to any vendor. We also see that our corporate clients are using content that spans all the cloud vendors; it’s difficult to find anyone who’s looking at a single vendor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Not long ago, we were skeptical about hybrid and multicloud. It’s easy to assume that these concepts are pipe dreams springing from the minds of vendors who are in second, third, fourth, or fifth place: if you can’t win customers from Amazon, at least you can get a slice of their business. That story isn’t compelling—but it’s also the wrong story to tell. Cloud computing is hybrid by nature. Think about how companies “get into the cloud.” It’s often a chaotic grassroots process rather than a carefully planned strategy. An engineer can’t get the resources for some project, so they create an AWS account, billed to the company credit card. Then someone in another group runs into the same problem, but goes with Azure. Next there’s an acquisition, and the new company has built its infrastructure on Google Cloud. And there’s petabytes of data on-premises, and that data is subject to regulatory requirements that make it difficult to move. The result? Companies have hybrid clouds long before anyone at the C-level perceives the need for a coherent cloud strategy. By the time the C suite is building a master plan, there are already mission-critical apps in marketing, sales, and product development. And the one way to fail is to dictate that “we’ve decided to unify on cloud X.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>All the cloud vendors, including Amazon (which until recently<a href=\"https://www.crn.com.au/news/aws-forbids-partners-even-mentioning-multi-cloud-529598\"> didn’t even allow its partners to use the word multicloud</a>), are being drawn to a strategy based not on locking customers into a specific cloud but on facilitating management of a hybrid cloud, and all offer tools to support hybrid cloud development. They know that support for hybrid clouds is key to cloud adoption–and, if there is any lock in, it will be around management. As IBM’s Rob Thomas has frequently said, “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ai-ladder/9781492073420/ch04.html\">Cloud is a capability, not a location</a>.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As expected, we see a lot of interest in microservices, with a 10% year-over-year increase—not large, but still healthy. Serverless (a.k.a. functions as a service) also shows a 10% increase, but with lower usage. That’s important: while it “feels like” serverless adoption has stalled, our data suggests that it’s growing in parallel with microservices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Security and Privacy</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Security has always been a problematic discipline: defenders have to get thousands of things right, while an attacker only has to discover one mistake. And that mistake might have been made by a careless user rather than someone on the IT staff. On top of that, companies have often underinvested in security: when the best sign of success is that “nothing bad happened,” it’s very difficult to say whether money was well spent. Was the team successful or just lucky?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Yet the last decade has been full of high-profile break-ins that have cost billions of dollars (including increasingly hefty penalties) and led to the <a href=\"https://www.csoonline.com/article/3510640/7-security-incidents-that-cost-cisos-their-jobs.html\">resignations and firings of C-suite executives</a>. Have companies learned their lessons?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The data doesn’t tell a clear story. While we’ve avoided discussing absolute usage, usage of content about security is very high—higher than for any other topic except for the major programming languages like Java and Python. Perhaps a better comparison would be to compare security with a general topic like programming or cloud. If we take that approach, programming usage is heavier than security, and security is only slightly behind cloud. So the usage of content about security is high, indeed, with year-over-year growth of 35%.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13627\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2021/01/76572_ORM_Platform_Analysis_Report_Data_Viz_Figure-8-1048x764.png\" /><figcaption><br /><em>Figure 8. Security and privacy</em></figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But what content are people using? Certification resources, certainly: CISSP content and training is 66% of general security content, with a slight (2%) decrease since 2019. Usage of content about the CompTIA Security+ certification is about 33% of general security, with a strong 58% increase.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a fair amount of interest in hacking, which shows 16% growth. Interestingly, ethical hacking (a subset of hacking) shows about half as much usage as hacking, with 33% growth. So we’re evenly split between good and bad actors, but the good guys are increasing more rapidly. Penetration testing, which should be considered a kind of ethical hacking, shows a 14% decrease; this shift may only reflect which term is more popular.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Beyond those categories, we get into the long tail: there’s only minimal usage of content about specific topics like phishing and ransomware, though ransomware shows a huge year-over-year increase (155%); that increase no doubt reflects the frequency and severity of ransomware attacks in the past year. There’s also a 130% increase in content about “zero trust,” a technology used to build defensible networks—though again, usage is small.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s disappointing that we see so little interest in content about privacy, including content about specific regulatory requirements such as GDPR. We don’t see heavy usage; we don’t see growth; we don’t even see significant numbers of search queries. This doesn’t bode well.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Not the End of the Story</strong></h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve taken a tour through a significant portion of the technology landscape. We’ve reported on the horse races along with the deeper stories underlying those races. Trends aren’t just the latest fashions; they’re also long-term processes. Containerization goes back to <a href=\"https://www.section.io/engineering-education/history-of-container-technology/\">Unix version 7 in 1979</a>; and didn’t Sun Microsystems invent the cloud in the 1990s with its workstations and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Ray\">Sun Ray</a> terminals? We may talk about “internet time,” but the most important trends span decades, not months or years—and often involve reinventing technology that was useful but forgotten, or technology that surfaced before its time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With that in mind, let’s take several steps back and think about the big picture. How are we going to harness the computing power needed for AI applications? We’ve talked about concurrency for decades, but it was only an exotic capability important for huge number-crunching tasks. That’s no longer true; we’ve run out of Moore’s law, and concurrency is table stakes. We’ve talked about system administration for decades, and during that time, the ratio of IT staff to computers managed has gone from many-to-one (one mainframe, many operators) to one-to-thousands (monitoring infrastructure in the cloud). As part of that evolution, automation has also gone from an option to a necessity. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve all heard that “everyone should learn to program.” This may be correct&#8230;or maybe not. It doesn’t mean that everyone should be a professional programmer but that everyone should be able to use computers effectively, and that requires programming. Will that be true in the future? No-code and low-code products are reaching the market, allowing users to build everything from business applications to AI prototypes. Again, this trend goes way back: in the late 1950s, the first modern programming languages made programming much easier. And yes, even back then there were those who said “real men use machine language.” (And that sexism was no doubt intentional, since the first generation of programmers included many women.) Will our future bring further democratization? Or a return to a cult of “wizards”? Low-code AI and complex JavaScript web platforms offer conflicting visions of what the future may bring.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, the most important trend may not yet appear in our data at all. Technology has largely gotten a free ride as far as regulation and legislation are concerned. Yes, there are heavily regulated sectors like healthcare and finance, but social media, much of machine learning, and even much of online commerce have only been lightly regulated. That free ride is coming to an end. Between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation\">GDPR</a>, the <a href=\"https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa\">California Consumer Privacy Act</a> (which will probably be copied by many states), California Propositions <a href=\"https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/22/\">22</a> and <a href=\"https://voterguide.sos.ca.gov/propositions/24/\">24</a>, many <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/smart-city-pdx/news/2020/9/9/city-council-approves-ordinances-banning-use-face-recognition\">city ordinances</a> regarding the use of face recognition, and rethinking the meaning of <a href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/whats-next-section-230-roundup-proposals\">Section 230</a> of the Communications Decency Act, laws and regulations will play a big role in shaping technology in the coming years. Some of that regulation was inevitable, but a lot of it is a direct response to an industry that moved too fast and broke too many things. In this light, the lack of interest in privacy and related topics is unhealthy. Twenty years ago, we built a future that we don’t really want to live in. The question facing us now is simple:<br /><br />What future will we build? </p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/GkgoCUslcr4\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Slaughter</em></a></cite></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Variants of artificial intelligence (AI), such as predictive modeling, statistical learning, and machine learning (ML), can create new value for organizations. AI can also cause costly reputational damage, get your organization slapped with a lawsuit, and run afoul of local, federal, or international regulations. Difficult questions about compliance and legality often pour cold water on late-stage AI deployments as well, because data scientists rarely get attorneys or oversight personnel involved in the build-stages of AI systems. Moreover, like many powerful commercial technologies, AI is likely to be highly regulated in the future.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article poses seven legal questions that data scientists should address before they deploy AI. This article is not legal advice. However, these questions and answers should help you better align your organization’s technology with existing and future laws, leading to less discriminatory and invasive customer interactions, fewer regulatory or litigation headwinds, and better return on AI investments. As the questions below indicate, it’s important to think about the legal implications of your AI system as you’re building it. Although many organizations wait until there’s an incident to call in legal help, compliance by design saves resources and reputations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Fairness: </strong>Are there outcome or accuracy differences in model decisions across protected groups? Are you documenting efforts to find and fix these differences?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/apple/ny-regulator-investigating-apple-card-possible-gender-bias-n1079581\">Alleged discrimination in credit lines</a>; <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/regulators-probe-racial-bias-with-unitedhealth-algorithm/563997722/\">Poor experimental design in healthcare algorithms</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Federal regulations require non-discrimination in consumer finance, employment, and other practices in the U.S. Local laws often extend these protections or define separate protections. Even if your AI isn’t directly affected by existing laws today, algorithmic discrimination can lead to <a href=\"https://algorithmwatch.org/en/story/google-vision-racism/\">reputational damage</a> and <a href=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/class-action/youtube-sued-for-race-discrimination-profiting-from-hate-speech\">lawsuits</a>, and the current political winds are blowing toward broader regulation of AI. To deal with the issue of algorithmic discrimination and to prepare for pending future regulations, organizations must improve cultural competencies, business processes, and tech stacks.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technology alone cannot solve algorithmic discrimination problems. Solid technology must be paired with culture and process changes, like increased demographic and professional diversity on the teams that build AI systems and better audit processes for those systems. Some additional non-technical solutions involve ethical principles for organizational AI usage, and a general mindset change. Going fast and breaking things isn’t the best idea when what you&#8217;re breaking are people’s loans, jobs, and healthcare.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a technical standpoint, you’ll need to start with careful experimental design and data that truly represents modeled populations. After your system is trained, all aspects of AI-based decisions should be tested for disparities across demographic groups: the system’s primary outcome, follow-on decisions, such as limits for credit cards, and manual overrides of automated decisions, along with the accuracy of all these decisions. In many cases, discrimination tests and any subsequent remediation must also be conducted using legally sanctioned techniques—not just your new favorite Python package. Measurements like adverse impact ratio, marginal effect, and standardized mean difference, along with prescribed methods for fixing discovered discrimination, are enshrined in regulatory commentary. Finally, you should document your efforts to address algorithmic discrimination. Such documentation shows your organization takes accountability for its AI systems seriously and can be invaluable if legal questions arise after deployment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Privacy</strong>: Is your model complying with relevant privacy regulations?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.biometricupdate.com/202007/facial-biometrics-training-dataset-leads-to-bipa-lawsuits-against-amazon-alphabet-and-microsoft\">Training data violates new state privacy laws</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Personal data is highly regulated, <a href=\"https://www.dlapiperdataprotection.com/\">even in the U.S.</a>, and nothing about using data in an AI system changes this fact. If you are using personal data in your AI system, you need to be mindful of existing laws and watch evolving state regulations, like the <a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/illinois-biometric-information-privacy-act-bipa-when-will-companies-heed-warning\">Biometric Information Privacy Act</a> (BIPA) in Illinois or the new <a href=\"https://www.manatt.com/insights/newsletters/client-alert/the-california-privacy-rights-act-has-passed\">California Privacy Rights Act</a> (CPRA). </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To cope with the reality of privacy regulations, teams that are engaged in AI also need to comply with organizational data privacy policies. Data scientists should familiarize themselves with these policies from the early stages of an AI project to help avoid privacy problems. At a minimum, these policies will likely address:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><strong>Consent for use:</strong> how consumer consent for data-use is obtained; the types of information collected; and ways for consumers to opt-out of data collection and processing.<br /></li><li><strong>Legal basis:</strong> any applicable privacy regulations to which your data or AI are adhering; why you’re collecting certain information; and associated consumer rights.<br /></li><li><strong>Anonymization requirements:</strong> how consumer data is aggregated and anonymized.<br /></li><li><strong>Retention requirements:</strong> how long you store consumer data; the security you have to protect that data; and if and how consumers can request that you delete their data. </li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given that most AI systems will change over time, you should also regularly audit your AI to ensure that it remains in compliance with your privacy policy over time. Consumer requests to delete data, or the addition of new data-hungry functionality, can cause legal problems, even for AI systems that were in compliance at the time of their initial deployment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One last general tip is to have an incident response plan. This is a lesson learned from general IT security. Among many other considerations, that plan should detail systematic ways to inform regulators and consumers if data has been breached or misappropriated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Security:</strong> Have you incorporated applicable security standards in your model? Can you detect if and when a breach occurs?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/report-ai-company-leaks-over-25m-medical-records\">Poor physical security for AI systems</a>; <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2016/09/how-to-steal-an-ai/\">Security attacks on ML</a>; <a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019-12-16-facial-recognition-fooled-masks.html\">Evasion attacks</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As consumer software systems, AI systems likely fall under various security standards and breach reporting laws. You’ll need to update your organization’s IT security procedures to apply to AI systems, and you’ll need to make sure that you can report if AI systems—data or algorithms—are compromised. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Luckily, the basics of IT security are <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/cybersecurity-small-business/cybersecuirty_sb_factsheets_all.pdf\">well-understood</a>. First, ensure that these are applied uniformly across your IT assets, including that super-secret new AI project and the rock-star data scientists working on it. Second, start preparing for <a href=\"https://github.com/mitre/advmlthreatmatrix\">inevitable attacks on AI</a>. These attacks tend to involve adversarial manipulation of AI-based decisions or the exfiltration of sensitive data from AI system endpoints. While these attacks are not common today, you don’t want to be the object lesson in AI security for years to come. So update your IT security policies to consider these new attacks. Standard counter-measures such as authentication and throttling at system endpoints go a long way toward promoting AI security, but newer approaches such as robust ML, differential privacy, and federated learning can make AI hacks even more difficult for bad actors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, you’ll need to report breaches if they occur in your AI systems. If your AI system is a labyrinthian black-box, that could be difficult. Avoid overly complex, black-box algorithms whenever possible, monitor AI systems in real-time for performance, security, and discrimination problems, and ensure system documentation is applicable for incident response and breach reporting purposes.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Agency:</strong> Is your AI system making unauthorized decisions on behalf of your organization?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/business-54698858\">Gig economy robo-firing</a>; <a href=\"https://futurism.com/investing-lawsuit-ai-trades-cost-millions\">AI executing equities trades</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If your AI system is making material decisions, it is crucial to ensure that it cannot make unauthorized decisions. If your AI is based on ML, as most are today, your system&#8217;s outcome is probabilistic: it <em>will</em> make wrong decisions. Wrong AI-based decisions about material matters—lending, financial transactions, employment, healthcare, or criminal justice, among others—can cause serious legal liabilities (see <strong>Negligence</strong> below). Worse still, using AI to mislead consumers can put your organization on the wrong side of an FTC enforcement action or a class action. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Every organization approaches risk management differently, so setting necessary limits on automated predictions is a business decision that requires input from many stakeholders. Furthermore, humans should review any AI decisions that implicate such limits before a customer&#8217;s final decision is issued. And don&#8217;t forget to routinely test your AI system with edge cases and novel situations to ensure it stays within those preset limits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Relatedly, and to quote the FTC, &#8220;[d]on&#8217;t deceive consumers about how you use automated tools.&#8221; In their <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/blogs/business-blog/2020/04/using-artificial-intelligence-algorithms\"><em>Using Artificial Intelligence and Algorithms</em></a> guidance, the FTC specifically called out companies for manipulating consumers with digital avatars posing as real people. To avoid this kind of violation, always inform your consumers that they are interacting with an automated system. It&#8217;s also a best practice to implement recourse interventions directly into your AI-enabled customer interactions. Depending on the context, an intervention might involve options to interact with a human instead, options to avoid similar content in the future, or a full-blown appeals process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Negligence:</strong> How are you ensuring your AI is safe and reliable?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong><a href=\"https://www.thedailyjournal.com/story/news/2019/07/10/nj-vineland-jules-black-christian-rodgers-june-district-court-rodriquez-product-liability-decision/1698558001/\">Releasing the wrong person from jail</a>; <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-uber-crash/in-review-of-fatal-arizona-crash-u-s-agency-says-uber-software-had-flaws-idUSKBN1XF2HA\">autonomous vehicle kills pedestrian</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI decision-making can lead to serious safety issues, including physical injuries. To keep your organization’s AI systems in check, the practice of model risk management–based roughly on the Federal Reserve’s <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr1107a1.pdf\">SR 11-7 letter</a>–is among the most tested frameworks for safeguarding predictive models against stability and performance failures.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For more advanced AI systems, a lot can go wrong. When creating autonomous vehicle or robotic process automation (RPA) systems, be sure to incorporate practices from the nascent discipline of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.07204\">safe and reliable machine learning</a>. Diverse teams, including domain experts, should think through possible incidents, compare their designs to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08512.pdf\">known past incidents</a>, document steps taken to prevent such incidents, and develop response plans to prevent inevitable glitches from spiraling out of control. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Transparency:</strong> Can you explain how your model arrives at a decision?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples: </strong>Proprietary algorithms hide data errors in <a href=\"https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/junejulyaugust-2017/code-of-silence/\">criminal sentencing</a> and <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/trueallele-software-transforming-how-courts-treat-dna-evidence/\">DNA testing</a></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Federal law already requires explanations for certain consumer finance decisions. Beyond meeting regulatory requirements, interpretability of AI system mechanisms enables human trust and understanding of these high-impact technologies, meaningful recourse interventions, and proper system documentation. Over recent years, two promising technological approaches have increased AI systems&#8217; interpretability: interpretable ML models and post-hoc explanations. Interpretable ML models (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href=\"https://github.com/interpretml/interpret\">explainable boosting machines</a>) are algorithms that are both highly accurate and highly transparent. Post-hoc explanations (<em>e.g.</em>, <a href=\"https://github.com/slundberg/shap\">Shapley values</a>) attempt to summarize ML model mechanisms and decisions. These two tools can be used together to increase your AI’s transparency. Given both the fundamental importance of interpretability and the technological process made toward this goal, it&#8217;s not surprising that new regulatory initiatives, like the FTC&#8217;s AI guidance and the CPRA, prioritize both consumer-level explanations and overall transparency of AI systems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3><strong>Third Parties:</strong> Does your AI system depend on third-party tools, services, or personnel? Are they addressing these questions?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Examples:</strong><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/09/29/artificial-intelligence-openai-gpt3-toxic/\">Natural language processing tools</a> and <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/11/03/researchers-show-that-computer-vision-algorithms-pretrained-on-imagenet-exhibit-multiple-distressing-biases/\">training data images</a> conceal discriminatory biases</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is rare for an AI system to be built entirely in-house without dependencies on third-party software, data, or consultants. When you use these third-party resources, third-party risk is introduced into your AI system. And, as the old saying goes, a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. Even if your organization takes the utmost precaution, any incidents involving your AI system, even if they stem from a third-party you relied on, can potentially be blamed on you. Therefore, it is essential to ensure that any parties involved in the design, implementation, review, or maintenance of your AI systems follow all applicable laws, policies, and regulations. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Before contracting with a third party, due diligence is required. Ask third parties for documentary proof that they take discrimination, privacy, security, and transparency seriously. And be on the lookout for signs of negligence, such as shoddy documentation, erratic software release cadences, lack of warranty, or unreasonably broad exceptions in terms of service or end-user license agreements (EULAs). You should also have contingency plans, including technical redundancies, incident response plans, and insurance covering third-party dependencies. Finally, don&#8217;t be shy about grading third-party vendors on a risk-assessment report card. Make sure these assessments happen over time, and not just at the beginning of the third-party contract. While these precautions may increase costs and delay your AI implementation in the short-term, they are the only way to mitigate third-party risks in your system consistently over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>Looking Ahead</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Several U.S. states and federal agencies have telegraphed their intentions regarding the future regulation of AI. Three of the broadest efforts to be aware of include the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/10/18304960/congress-algorithmic-accountability-act-wyden-clarke-booker-bill-introduced-house-senate\">Algorithmic Accountability Act</a>, the FTC’s AI guidance, and the CPRA. Numerous other industry-specific guidance documents are being drafted, such as the FDA’s proposed <a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/media/122535/download?mod=article_inline\">framework</a> for AI in medical devices and FINRA’s <a href=\"https://www.finra.org/sites/default/files/2020-06/ai-report-061020.pdf\"><em>Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Securities Industry</em></a>. Furthermore, other countries are setting examples for U.S. policymakers and regulators to follow. <a href=\"https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/about-the-opc/what-we-do/consultations/completed-consultations/consultation-ai/reg-fw_202011/\">Canada</a>, <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/doceo/document/TA-9-2020-0276_EN.pdf\">the European Union</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pdpc.gov.sg/Help-and-Resources/2020/01/Model-AI-Governance-Framework\">Singapore</a>, and the <a href=\"https://ico.org.uk/about-the-ico/news-and-events/ai-blog-an-overview-of-the-auditing-framework-for-artificial-intelligence-and-its-core-components/\">United Kingdom</a>, among others, have all drafted or implemented detailed regulations for different aspects of AI and automated decision-making systems. In light of this government movement, and the growing public and government distrust of big tech, now is the perfect time to start minimizing AI system risk and prepare for future regulatory compliance.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/oEkATE7hJc4\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

The idea comes from the work of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Alexander\">Christopher Alexander</a> in architecture; patterns are things like &#8220;rooms on both sides of a hallway&#8221; or &#8220;door on the front of a building.&#8221;&nbsp; There’s a lot we can unpack from this simple definition:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Design patterns are not invented.&nbsp; They are observed. They aren’t about inventing (or re-inventing) wheels; they’re about noticing “I’ve put wheels on three things lately. Might be a good idea…” The first time you put wheels on something is an invention.&nbsp; It becomes a pattern when you observe that you’re re-inventing the wheel, and that’s a good thing. The wheel becomes part of your repertoire of solutions.<br /></li><li>Design patterns are not algorithms, which are specific solutions to generalized problems.&nbsp;Quicksort isn’t a pattern–nor is sorting itself.&nbsp; Patterns have more to do with how software is organized. They are more like stories, in which a problem leads to a solution that coordinates a number of different parts.<br /></li><li>Design patterns are often used without thinking; they feel natural, not clever, and that’s why they’re common. You’ll find them in your code; you’ll find them in the code of others.&nbsp; You can find them even if they weren’t put there consciously; patterns are often no more than a common solution to a certain kind of problem, something that looks obvious in retrospect. Patterns become a problem when programmers try to force the issue–to use patterns where they don’t quite fit, because they’ve heard that design patterns make their code better.<br /></li><li>Design patterns aren&#8217;t inherently good–and if you read Alexander, you’ll find that there are plenty of architectural patterns that he really doesn’t like. A corridor with rooms on both sides is a solution to certain architectural problems. It is frequently found in very boring hotels and offices.<br /></li><li>&#8220;Anti-patterns&#8221; may be worth avoiding, but that doesn&#8217;t mean they aren&#8217;t patterns. Frequently observed bad solutions to common problems are still frequently observed solutions to common problems. And sometimes, anti-patterns will be the best possible solution to an otherwise intractable problem. That’s the kind of technical debt that enables you to ship, as <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/on-exactitude-in-technical-debt/\">Kevlin Henney</a> and <a href=\"https://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html\">Ward Cunningham</a> have written.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There isn’t any magic here. While the book <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/design-patterns-elements/0201633612/\">Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software</a> by Gamma, Helm, Johnson, and Vlissides (the “Gang of Four”) is a classic, design patterns really aren’t things you look up in books. Design patterns are things you find in your code; they’d probably be there whether or not they had a name. So what’s the value?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The biggest value in design patterns is that it gives us a common language for talking about software and how it’s organized. That’s why Alexander named one of his books <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Pattern-Language-Buildings-Construction-Environmental/dp/0195019199/\">A Pattern Language</a>. We’ve all spent hours making diagrams on black- or white-boards to show how some software we’re writing is organized. Design patterns give a common vocabulary so that we can discuss software with some certainty that we all mean the same thing. I eventually realized that UML had the same aim: UML diagrams are like architectural blueprints, in which one kind of line represents a brick wall, another wood, another plasterboard. Unfortunately, UML was never quite standard enough, and like design patterns, was perceived as a good in itself. In the end, a common vocabulary (whether a pattern catalog or UML) is a tool, and any tool can be abused.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since the Gang of Four, design patterns have been associated with object-oriented programming, but the idea that patterns aren’t applicable to functional languages is itself meaningless. It’s certainly true that in functional languages, some well-known patterns (like strategy or map/reduce) are either primitives or simple library functions; but saying that there aren’t patterns in functional programming is equivalent to saying that there are no common solutions to common problems. It’s still useful to point out that the “strategy” pattern is equivalent to passing a function as a parameter to another function. That language gives you an intuitive and descriptive way to discuss solutions to a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Patterns change over time, as problems change; there’s nothing special to the patterns the Gang of Four observed in the 1990s. In the 2020s, we should be building a pattern language for concurrent programming–and we may find that our patterns for the enterprise software of the 90s are less relevant.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You may find that you use patterns without thinking about it; you may discover patterns in your code; you may realize you&#8217;re facing a problem that a pattern will help you to solve; or you may use patterns to describe solutions to someone else. When solving a problem, sometimes the only thing you’re missing is a name; having a name for your solution crystallizes it. Studying patterns is useful because it gives you a larger vocabulary with which to think about problems and solutions. But using patterns for their own sake leads you nowhere. I remember hearing about programmers boasting about how many Gang of Four patterns they used, and managers telling programmers to use more patterns.&nbsp; That’s not productive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like any good thing in programming, using design patterns should help you solve complex problems more simply. But there&#8217;s no guarantee that they&#8217;ll do that. And if you find that they aren&#8217;t, then you should research for some other solutions.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/V-tBrJdLrNo\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Around the world, organizations and their workforces have risen to the occasion, recognizing the importance of expanding their knowledge, taking on new tasks, and bettering themselves both personally and professionally. With the uptick in virtual conferencing, remote work, and, for some, reentering the job market, new technology adoption was accelerated, driving the workforce to build new skills. While 2020 was the year of the global COVID-19 pandemic, it will also be commemorated as the year online learning prevailed. As vaccine development persists and life gets back to normal, with it will come a more future-proof workforce ready to share their new knowledge with the world.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Since the onset of the pandemic, online courses and programs have seen dramatic spikes in consumption and enrollment, and O’Reilly has been no different. A big contributor to O’Reilly’s continued success during these unprecedented times has been its live virtual training courses. This year, more than 900,000 users have registered for live events through O’Reilly online learning—a 96% increase from last year. This functionality also allowed O’Reilly to introduce its <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/pub/pr/3299\">Superstream Series</a>, a new lineup of virtual conferences featuring expert speakers delivering talks and training sessions on the most important topics and emerging trends in technology.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So what are the trends driving this uptick in learning? Companies are increasingly interested in understanding how to successfully adjust to remote work and effectively manage time. And individual O’Reilly members are looking to build and expand on their technical skills in everything from software architecture and microservices to AI and programming languages. But which topics are the brightest minds in technology most focused on?

       "     'value': '<p>It has long seemed to me that functional programming is, essentially, programming viewed as mathematics. Many ideas in functional programming came from Alonzo Church&#8217;s Lambda Calculus, which significantly predates anything that looks remotely like a modern computer. Though the actual history of computing runs differently: in the early days of computing, Von Neumann’s ideas were more important than Church’s, and had a tremendous influence on the design of early computers—an influence that continues to the present. Von Neumann’s thinking was essentially imperative: a program is a list of commands that run on a machine designed to execute those commands.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So, what does it mean to say that functional programming is programming &#8220;viewed as mathematics&#8221;? Von Neumann was a “mathematician,” and programming of all kinds found its first home in Mathematics departments. So, if functional programming is mathematical, what does that mean? What kind of math?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’m not thinking of any specific branch of mathematics. Yes, the Lambda Calculus has significant ties to set theory, logic, category theory, and many other branches of mathematics. But let’s start with grade school mathematics and assignment statements; they&#8217;re basic to any programming language. We&#8217;re all familiar with code like this:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;i = i+1 # or, more simply\\n&nbsp; i += 1&nbsp; # or, even more simply\\n&nbsp; i++ &nbsp; &nbsp; # C, Java, but not Python or Ruby</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Mathematically, this is nonsense. An equation is a statement about a relationship that holds true. <code>i</code> can equal <code>i</code>; it can&#8217;t equal <code>i+1</code>. And while <code>i++</code> and <code>i+=1</code> no longer look like equations, they are equally nonsensical; once you&#8217;ve said that <code>i</code> equals something, you can&#8217;t say it equals something else. &#8220;Variables&#8221; don&#8217;t change values; they&#8217;re immutable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Immutability is one of the most important principles of functional programming. Once you&#8217;ve defined a variable, you can&#8217;t change it. (You can create a new one in a different function scope, but that&#8217;s a different matter.) Variables, in functional programming, are invariant; and that&#8217;s important. You may be wondering &#8220;what about loops? How can I write a <code>for</code> loop?&#8221; Not only do you have to do without index variables, you can’t modify any of the variables in the loop body.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Setting aside the (solvable) problem of iteration, there’s no reason you can&#8217;t write code in (almost) any non-functional language that has this same effect. Just declare all your variables <code>final</code> or <code>const</code>. In the long run, functional programming is more about a specific kind of discipline than about language features. Programming languages can enforce certain rules, but in just about any modern language it&#8217;s possible to follow those rules without language support.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another important principle of functional programming is that functions are &#8220;first class entities.&#8221; That is, there are minimal restrictions about where you can use a function. You can also have functions without names, often called &#8220;lambdas” (which refers directly to the Lambda Calculus, in which functions were unnamed).&nbsp; In Python, you can write code like this:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;data.sort(key=lambda r: r[COLUMN])</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The &#8220;key&#8221; is an anonymous function that returns a specific column of an array; that function is then used for sorting. Personally, I&#8217;m not overly fond of &#8220;anonymous functions&#8221;; it&#8217;s often clearer to write the anonymous function as a regular, named function. So I might write this:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;def sortbycolumn(r): return r[COLUMN]\\n&nbsp; data.sort(k=sortbycolumn)</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The ability to use functions as arguments to functions gives you a very nice way to implement the &#8220;strategy pattern&#8221;:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;def squareit(x): &nbsp; return x*x\\n&nbsp; def cubeit(x): &nbsp; &nbsp; return x*x*x\\n  def rootit(x): &nbsp; &nbsp; import math; return math.sqrt(x)\\n&nbsp; def do_something(strategy, x) ...\\n\\n  do_something(cubeit, 42)\\n  weird = lambda x : cubeit(rootit(x))\\n  do_something(weird, 42)</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I often get the sense that all programmers really<em> </em>want from functional programming is first-class functions and lambdas. Lambdas were added to Python very early on (1.0) but didn&#8217;t reach Java until Java 8.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another consequence of thinking mathematically (and possibly a more important one) is that functions can&#8217;t have side-effects and, given the same arguments, will always return the same value. If a mathematician (or a high school trig student) writes</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;y = sin(x)</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>they don&#8217;t have to deal with the possibility that <code>sin(x)</code> sets some global variable to 42, or will return a different value every time it’s called. That just can&#8217;t happen; in math, the idea of a &#8220;side-effect&#8221; is meaningless. All the information that <code>sin(x)</code> provides is encapsulated in the return value. In most programming languages, side-effects happen all too easily, and in some, they&#8217;re almost an obsession. Again, creating functions that have no side-effects is a matter of exercising discipline. A programming language can enforce this rule, but you can follow it whether or not your language makes you do it. We don’t have cartoon devils looking over our shoulders saying &#8220;Go ahead; make a side effect. No one will notice.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Functional languages vary the degree to which they enforce the lack of side-effects. If you&#8217;re a purist, anything that interacts with the real world is a side-effect. Printing a document? Changing a row in a database? Displaying a value on the user&#8217;s screen? Those are all side-effects (they aren&#8217;t completely encapsulated in the value returned by the function), and they have to be &#8220;hidden&#8221; using a mechanism like monads in Haskell. And that&#8217;s the point at which many programmers get confused and throw up their hands in despair. (I&#8217;ll only point you to <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/real-world-haskell/9780596155339/\">Real World Haskell</a>.) In both Java and Python, lambda functions can have side-effects, which means that, strictly speaking, they aren’t really “functional.” Guido van Rossum&#8217;s discussion of the addition of Lambdas to Python is worth reading; among other things, he\\xa0<a href=\"http://python-history.blogspot.com/2009/04/origins-of-pythons-functional-features.html\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">says</a>\\xa0&#8220;I have never considered Python to be heavily influenced by functional languages, no matter what people say or think.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Streams are often associated with functional languages; they’re essentially long (perhaps infinite) lists that are evaluated lazily—meaning that elements of the string are only evaluated as they&#8217;re needed. Maps apply a function to every element of a list, returning a new list—and that includes streams, which (for these purposes) are specialized lists. That&#8217;s an incredibly useful feature; it&#8217;s a great way to write a loop without having to write a loop—and without even knowing how much data you have. You can also create “filters” that choose whether to pass any element of the stream to the output, and you can chain maps and filters together. If you think this sounds like a Unix pipeline, you’re right. Streams, maps, filters, and the act of chaining them together really have as much to do with the Unix shell as they do with functional languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another way to avoid writing loops is to use &#8220;comprehensions,&#8221; a feature of Python. It&#8217;s easy to get very fond of list comprehensions; they&#8217;re compact, they eliminate off-by-one errors, and they&#8217;re very flexible. Although comprehensions look like a compact notation for a traditional loop, they really come from set theory—and their closest computational “relatives” are to be found in relational databases, rather than functional programming. Here’s a comprehension that applies a function to every element of a list:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">&nbsp;&nbsp;# pythonic examples.&nbsp; First, list comprehension \\n&nbsp; newlist = [ somefunction(thing) for thing in things ] </pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The most general way to avoid traditional loops is to use recursion: a function that calls itself. Here’s the recursive equivalent to the previous comprehension:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<pre class=\"wp-block-preformatted\">def iterate(t, l) :\\n    if len(t) == 0 : return l     # stop when all elements are done\\n    return iterate(t[1:],l + [somefunction(t[0])]) # process remainder</pre>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Recursion is a mainstay of functional languages: you don’t have indices being modified, and you’re not even modifying the resulting list (assuming that append doesn’t count as modification).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, recursion has its own problems. It&#8217;s hard to wrap your mind around recursion; you still need to do a lot of your own bookkeeping (in this case, passing in a vector so a result can be returned); and except in one (common) special case, called &#8220;tail recursion,&#8221; it can be a performance nightmare.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I started by saying that functional programming was programming considered as “math,” and that’s at least partially correct. But is that claim useful? There are many branches of mathematics that map onto programming concepts in different ways. Functional programming only represents one of them. If you’re a topologist, you may well like graph databases. But discussing which branch of mathematics corresponds to which programming practices isn’t really helpful. Remembering high school algebra may help when thinking about immutability, statelessness, and the absence of side-effects; but most programmers will never study the real mathematical origins of functional programing. Lambdas are great; functions as arguments in method calls is great; even recursion is (sometimes) great; but we’re fooling ourselves if we think programmers are going to start using Java as if it were Haskell. But that’s OK; for Java programmers, the value of Lambdas isn’t some mathematical notion of “functional,” but in providing a huge improvement over anonymous inner classes. The tools to be functional are there, should you choose to use them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In college, I learned that engineering was about making tradeoffs. Since then, I’ve heard very few programmers talk about tradeoffs—but those tradeoffs are still central to good engineering. And while engineering uses a lot of mathematics, engineering isn’t mathematics, in part because mathematics doesn’t deal in tradeoffs. Using “mathematics” as a way to think about a particular style of disciplined coding maybe be useful, particularly if that discipline leads to fewer bugs. It’s also useful to use the tools of mathematics to make good tradeoffs between rigor, performance, and practicality—which may lead you in an entirely different direction. Be as functional as you need to (but no more).&nbsp;<br /></p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/f62LG1ACBmI\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>If software is such stuff as dreams are made on, how do we talk about nightmares? Software is not the tangible, kickable stuff our senses are tuned to, so we draw on metaphor to communicate and reason about it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The 1970s offered up <em>spaghetti code</em> to describe the tangle of unstructured control flow. This has inspired many software-as-pasta descriptions, from lasagne for layered architectures to ravioli for—pick a decade—objects, components, modules, services, and microservices. Beyond its disordered arrangement, however, spaghetti has little to offer us as a metaphor. It doesn&#8217;t provide us with a useful mental model for talking about code, and has far too many positive associations. If you love both ravioli and spaghetti, it&#8217;s not obvious that one of these is worse for your software architecture than the other.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A metaphor is a mapping that we use to describe one thing in terms of another—sometimes because we want to show something familiar from an unfamiliar angle, as in poetry, but sometimes because we want to show something unfamiliar or abstract in a more familiar light, as in software. To be considered good, a metaphor has to offer a number of points of useful correspondence with what is being described. Pasta doesn&#8217;t quite do this.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another quality of a good metaphor is that it should not have too many obvious points of conflict. It will never map its target perfectly—a metaphor is a conceit not an identity—but a good metaphor is one whose key qualities don&#8217;t contradict the very thing we are trying to say, whose points of difference don&#8217;t distract from the mental model being shared.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We sometimes talk about <em>code decay</em> and <em>software rot</em>. These terms give a sense of degradation over time. This seems accurate and relatable. They also suggest a response: cleaning (we brush our teeth to reduce the chance of tooth decay) or treatment (we treat wood to avoid it rotting). So far so good… but the problem with these metaphors is they refer to natural processes that happen independently of anything we do. If you don&#8217;t brush your teeth, you will experience decay. If you don&#8217;t touch code, it doesn&#8217;t intrinsically degrade.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The third quality of a metaphor that makes it effective is familiarity to its audience. Explaining something unfamiliar in terms of something else that is also unfamiliar can be a long road to travel a short distance (or to end up where you started). If you are familiar with the concept of entropy in statistical mechanics, with the second law of thermodynamics, and with the idea that work is needed to reduce entropy and increase order in a system, then <em>software entropy</em> might strike you as a descriptive metaphor—and not simply because the word <em>work</em> transfers happily from the world of thermodynamics to the day-to-day experience of developers. If, however, these concepts are not accessible and require explanation, then, regardless of its other merits, <em>software entropy</em> may not be the best way to talk about accidental complexity in code.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Perhaps the most popular metaphor in use is based on financial debt, originating with Ward Cunningham in <a href=\"http://c2.com/doc/oopsla92.html\">1992</a>. As Martin Fowler described in <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20030919182513/http://martinfowler.com:80/bliki/TechnicalDebt.html\">2003</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Technical Debt is a wonderful metaphor developed by Ward Cunningham to help us think about this problem. In this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choice.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When we look at <em>technical debt</em>, we see a metaphor that checks all three boxes: it has a number of useful points of correspondence; the points of difference don&#8217;t overwhelm the core idea; it is familiar. Furthermore, it brings with it a useful working vocabulary. For example, consider what the following debt-related words suggest to you in a software context: repayment, consolidation, creditworthiness, write-off, borrowing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although we know that by definition no metaphor is perfect, there are two common ways in which the metaphor is misapplied: assuming technical debt is necessarily something bad; equating technical debt with a financial debt value. The emphasis of the former is misaligned and the latter is a category error.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we are relying on the common experience of our audience, financial debt is almost always thought of as a burden. If we take that together with the common experience of code quality and nudge it with leading descriptions such as &#8220;quick and dirty,&#8221; it is easy to see how in everyday use <em>technical debt</em> has become synonymous with poor code and poor practice. We are, however, drawing too heavily on the wrong connotation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Rather than reckless debt, such as from gambling, we should be thinking more along the lines of prudent debt, such as a mortgage. A mortgage should be offered based on our credit history and our ability to pay and, in return, we are able to buy a house that might otherwise have been beyond our reach. Similarly, Ward&#8217;s original motivation was to highlight how debt in code can be used for competitive advantage:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Shipping first time code is like going into debt. A little debt speeds development so long as it is paid back promptly with a rewrite.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This comes with a clear caveat and implication: a debt is a loan. A debt is for repayment, not for running up:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>The danger occurs when the debt is not repaid. Every minute spent on not-quite-right code counts as interest on that debt. Entire engineering organizations can be brought to a stand-still under the debt load of an unconsolidated implementation.</p></blockquote>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As in the real world, how we run up debt and how we manage it turn out to be more complex than the simplicity of our best intentions. There are teams that make time-saving decisions wisely, revisiting and addressing them later in a timely manner. But in most cases where debt is incurred, discussed, and lamented, codebases reflect the firefight of different priorities, skills, and people. It&#8217;s still technical debt, but it lacks the prudence and intention of Ward&#8217;s original purpose.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are also teams and tools that embrace the debt metaphor so tightly that they forget it&#8217;s a metaphor. They treat it literally and numerically, converting code quality into a currency value on a spreadsheet or dashboard. The consequences of this <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/thinko\">thinko</a> range from being a harmless fiction largely ignored by developers and managers to a more damaging numerology that, even though it&#8217;s well intentioned, can mislead development effort.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we&#8217;re going to quantify it, what is it we&#8217;re quantifying? Do we list off code smells? What is the debt value of a code smell? Is it constant per kind of code smell? For example, is duplicate code characterised by a single cost? And are code smells independent of one another? Consider that, for example, duplication is sometimes used to reduce coupling, so the debit becomes a credit in that context. We can conclude that a code smell is not an isolated thing with a single look-up debt value, so this is clearly a more complex problem dependent on many factors. As a multivariable problem, what does it depend on? And how? And how do we know? And what would the value or—more likely—value distribution reflect? The cost of fixing? Or, more honestly, an estimate of the cost of fixing?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But even if we are somehow able to conjure a number out of this ever-growing list of considerations—and even if that number has some relation to observed reality—we have put a number to the wrong quantity. We have, in fact, missed the whole point of the metaphor.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technical debt is not the cost of repaying the debt: it is the cost of owning the debt. These are not the same. That is the message of the technical debt metaphor: it is not simply a measure of the specific work needed to repay the debt; it is the additional time and effort added to all past, present, and future work that comes from having the debt in the first place.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By taking the metaphor literally, we have robbed it of its value. Its value is to offer us a figure of speech not of currency, a mental model for talking and reasoning about qualities of our code that are not simply stated in code. No matter how well meant, pushing any metaphor beyond its applicability leads to <a href=\"https://weeklysift.com/2011/10/24/expand-your-vocabulary-metaphor-shear/\">metaphor shear</a>. It is, after all, metaphor and not identity.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/bg5d6LQU2Zg\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

Over the past two decades, we&#8217;ve seen the rise of hybrid programming languages that combine both functional and object-oriented features. Some of these languages (like Scala) were multi-paradigm from the beginning. Others, like Python (in the transition from Python 2 to 3) or Java (with the introduction of Lambdas in Java 8) are object-oriented or procedural languages to which functional features were added. Although we think of C++ as an object-oriented language, it has also been multi-paradigm from the beginning. It started with C, a procedural language, and added object-oriented features. Later, beginning with the Standard Template Library, C++ was influenced by many ideas from Scheme, a descendant of LISP.\\xa0 JavaScript was also heavily influenced by Scheme, and popularized the idea of anonymous functions and functions as first class objects. And JavaScript was object-oriented from the start, with a prototype-based object model and syntax (though not semantics) that gradually evolved to become similar to Java’s.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve also seen the rise of languages combining static and dynamic typing (TypeScript in the JavaScript world; the addition of optional type hinting in Python 3.5; Rust has some limited dynamic typing features). Typing is another dimension in paradigm space. Dynamic typing leads to languages that make programming fun and where it’s easy to be productive, while strict typing makes it significantly easier to build, understand, and debug large systems. It’s always been easy to find people praising dynamic languages, but, except for a few years in the late 00s, the dynamic-static paradigmatic hasn’t attracted as much attention.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Why do we still see holy wars between advocates of functional and object-oriented programming? That strikes me as a huge missed opportunity. What might &#8220;multi-paradigm programming&#8221; mean? What would it mean to reject purity and use whatever set of features provide the best solution in any given context? Most significant software is substantial enough that it certainly has components where an object-oriented paradigm makes more sense, and components where a functional paradigm is superior.\\xa0 For example, look at a “functional” feature like recursion.\\xa0 There are certainly algorithms that make much more sense recursively (Towers of Hanoi, or printing a sorted binary tree in order); there are algorithms where it doesn’t make much of a difference whether you use loops or recursion (whenever tail recursion optimizations will work); and there are certainly cases where recursion will be slow and memory-hungry. How many programmers know which solution is best in any situation?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These are the sort of questions we need to start asking. Design patterns have been associated with object-oriented programming from the beginning. What kinds of design patterns make sense in a multi-paradigm world? Remember that design patterns aren&#8217;t &#8220;invented&#8221;; they&#8217;re observed, they&#8217;re solutions to problems that show up again and again, and that should become part of your repertoire. It&#8217;s unfortunate that functional programmers tend not to talk about design patterns; when you realize that patterns are observed solutions, statements like &#8220;patterns aren&#8217;t needed in functional languages&#8221; cease to make sense. Functional programmers certainly solve problems, and certainly see the same solutions show up repeatedly. We shouldn’t expect those problems and solutions to be the same problems and solutions that OO programmers observe. What patterns yield the best of both paradigms? What patterns might help to determine which approach is most appropriate in a given situation?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Programming languages represent ways of thinking about problems. Over the years, the paradigms have multiplied, along with the problems we’re interested in solving. We now talk about event-driven programming, and many software systems are event-driven, at least on the front end. Metaprogramming was popularized by JUnit, the first widely used tool to rely on this feature that’s more often associated with functional languages; since then, several drastically different versions of metaprogramming have made new things possible in Java, Ruby, and other languages.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&#8217;ve never really addressed the problem of how to make these paradigms play well together; so far, languages that support multiple paradigms have left it to the programmers to figure out how to use them. But simply mixing paradigms ad hoc probably isn’t the ideal way to build large systems–and we&#8217;re now building software at scales and speeds that were hard to imagine only a few years ago. Our tools have improved; now we need to learn how to use them well. And that will inevitably involve blending paradigms that we’ve long viewed as distinct, or even in conflict.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>Thanks to Kevlin Henney for ideas and suggestions!</em></p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/mA0IUyEp8u0\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

All of this fills in more pieces to the puzzle.&nbsp; Sometimes, it sheds light on parts of the puzzle you didn&#8217;t know existed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>By comparison, yes/no questions implicitly demand nothing more than what was expressly asked.&nbsp; That makes them too easy to dodge.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Two, a good question <em>challenges the person asking it</em> as much as (if not more than) the person who is expected to answer.&nbsp; Anyone can toss out questions at random, in an attempt to fill the silence. To pose <em>useful</em> questions requires that you first understand the present situation, know where you want to wind up, and map out stepping-stones between the two.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Case in point: the Daniel Pennac line that opened this piece was uttered by a detective who was &#8220;interviewing&#8221; a person in a coma.&nbsp; As he inspected their wounds, he asked more questions to&nbsp; explore their backstory, and that helped him to piece together his next steps of the investigation.&nbsp; Perhaps Inspector Pennac was inspired by Georg Cantor, who once said: &#8220;To ask the right question is harder than to answer it.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Three, a good question <em>doesn&#8217;t always have a right answer</em>.&nbsp; Some of them don&#8217;t have any answer at all.&nbsp; And that&#8217;s fine. Sometimes the goal of asking a question is to break the ice on a topic, opening a discussion that paints a larger picture.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Four, sometimes a question is effective precisely because<em> it comes from an unexpected place or person</em>.&nbsp;While writing this piece, one author pointed out (spoiler alert) that the attorney asked all of the technical questions, which seems odd, until you realize that he&#8217;s had to ask those because other people did not. When questions seem to come out of nowhere—but they are really born of experience—they can shake people out of the fog of status quo and open their eyes to new thoughts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>A brief disclaimer</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The opinions presented here are personal, do not reflect the view of our employers, and are not professional product, consulting, or legal advice.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>The questions</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What does this company <em>really</em> do?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> This is the kind of question you sometimes have to ask three times.&nbsp;The first time, someone will try to hand you the company&#8217;s mission statement or slogan.&nbsp;The second time, they&#8217;ll provide a description of the company: industry vertical, size, and revenue.&nbsp;So you ask again, this time with an emphasis on the <em>really</em>.&nbsp;And then you wait for the question to sink in, and for the person to work backwards from all of the company&#8217;s disparate activities to see what it&#8217;s all truly <em>for.</em>&nbsp;Which will be somewhere between the <em>raison d&#8217;etre </em>and the <em>sine qua non.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Taking the time to work this out is like building a mathematical model: if you understand what a company <em>truly</em> does, you don&#8217;t just get a better understanding of the present, but you can also predict the future.&nbsp;It guides decisions such as what projects to implement, what competitors to buy, and whom to hire into certain roles.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a concrete example, take Amazon.&nbsp;Everyone thinks it&#8217;s a store. It <em>has</em> a store, but at its core, Amazon is a delivery/logistics powerhouse.&nbsp; Everything they do has to end with your purchases winding up in your hot little hands. Nothing else they do matters—not the slick website, not the voice-activated ordering, not the recommendation engine—unless they get delivery and logistics down.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I explore this early in a consulting relationship.&nbsp;Sometimes even early in the sales cycle. And I don&#8217;t try to hide it; I&#8217;ll ask it, flat-out, and wait for people to fill the silence.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> My work focuses on helping companies to start, restart, and assess their ML/AI efforts. Understanding the company&#8217;s true purpose unlocks the business model and sheds light on what is useful to do with the data. As a bonus, it can also highlight cases of conflict.&nbsp;Because sometimes key figures have very different ideas of what the company is and what it should do next.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> This question can catch people off-guard.&nbsp; Since I work in the AI space, people sometimes have a preconceived notion that I&#8217;ll only talk about data and models.&nbsp; Hearing this question from an ostensibly technical person can be jarring… though, sometimes, that can actually help the conversation along.&nbsp; So it&#8217;s definitely a double-edged sword.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What is a bad idea?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> Ideation is about coming up with the &#8220;best&#8221; ideas. What is the best way to solve this problem? What is the most important? What is best for the business?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The problem with &#8220;best&#8221; is that it is tied up with all of the biases and assumptions someone already has. To get to what really matters we have to understand the edge of what is good or bad. The gray area between those tells you the shape of the problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Half the time this question will give you real, bad ideas.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What has been surprising to me is that the other half of the time, the so-called &#8220;bad&#8221; idea is really a &#8220;good&#8221; idea in disguise.&nbsp; You just have to relax certain assumptions. Often these assumptions were just set at some point without a reason or much to back it up.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I like to ask this after going through a lot of the &#8220;best&#8221; questions in an ideation session. It can be adapted to focus on different types of &#8220;bad,&#8221; like &#8220;stupid,&#8221; &#8220;wasteful,&#8221; and &#8220;unethical.&#8221;&nbsp; Ask follow up questions about why they believe the idea is &#8220;bad&#8221; and why it might actually be &#8220;good.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> How can you truly know what is good without also knowing what is bad?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> When I was a design consultant working for clients in highly regulated industries (.e.g banking, insurance, etc.), I found this can be a difficult question to ask. In those cases you will need to get your legal team to either grant the attorney/client privilege to ask the questions, or ask the prompt/response in such a way that it protects people in the conversation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>How did you obtain your training data?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> In the early days of ML training data, companies and research teams frequently used “some stuff we found on the Internet” as a source for training data. This approach has two problems: (1) there may not be an appropriate license attached to the data, and (2) the data may not be a good representative sample for the intended use. It’s worth noting that the first issue is not just limited to images collected from the Internet. In recent years a number of research datasets (including Stanford’s Brainwash, Microsoft’s MS Celeb, and Duke’s MTMC) were withdrawn for reasons including a lack of clarity around the permission and rights granted by people appearing in the datasets. More recently, at least one company has earned itself significant PR and legal controversy for collecting training data sources from social media platforms under circumstances that were at least arguably a violation of both the platform’s terms of service and platform users&#8217; legal rights.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The safest course of action is also the slowest and most expensive: obtain your training data as part of a collection strategy that includes efforts to obtain the correct representative sample under an explicit license for use <em>as training data</em>. The next best approach is to use existing data collected under broad licensing rights that include use as training data even if that use was not the explicit purpose of the collection.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I like to ask this as early as possible.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t want to invest your time, effort, and money building models only to later realize that you can’t use them, or that using them will be much more expensive than anticipated because of unexpected licenses or royalty payments. It’s also a good indirect measure of training data quality: a team that does not know where their data originated is likely to not know other important details about the data as well.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> No matter how the data is collected, a review by legal counsel before starting a project—and allow me to emphasise the word <em>before</em>—can prevent significant downstream headaches.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong>&nbsp; This question is most useful when asked before the model goes into production. It loses value once the model is on sale or in service, particularly if it is embedded in a hardware device that can’t be easily updated.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What is the intended use of the model? How many people will use it? And what happens when it fails?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> One of the most interesting aspects of machine learning (ML) is its very broad applicability across a variety of industries and use cases. ML can be used to identify cats in photos as well as to guide autonomous vehicles. Understandably, the potential harm caused by showing a customer a dog when they expected to see a cat is significantly different from the potential harm caused by an autonomous driving model failing to properly recognize a stop sign.&nbsp; Determining the risk profile of a given model requires a case-by-case evaluation but it can be useful to think of the failure risk in three broad categories:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might die or have their sensitive data exposed”</em> — Examples of these kinds of uses include automated driving/flying systems and biometric access features. ML models directly involved in critical safety systems are generally easy to identify as areas of concern. That said, the risks involved require a very careful evaluation of the processes used to generate, test, and deploy those models, particularly in cases where there are significant public risks involved in any of the aforementioned steps.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, someone might lose access to an important service”</em> — Say, payment fraud detection and social media content detection algorithms.&nbsp;Most of us have had the experience of temporarily losing access to a credit card for buying something that “didn’t fit our spending profile.” Recently, a law professor who <em>studies</em> automated content moderation was suspended … by a social media platform&#8217;s automated content moderation system. All this because they quoted a reporter who <em>writes</em> about automated content moderation. These kinds of service-access ML models are increasingly used to make decisions about what we can spend, what we can say, and even where and how we can travel. The end-user risks are not as critical as in a safety or data protection system, but their failure can represent a significant reputation risk to the business that uses them when the failure mode is to effectively ban users from a product or service. It is important for companies employing ML in these situations to understand how this all fits into the overall risk profile of the company. They&#8217;d do well to carefully weigh the relative merit of using ML to <em>augment</em> existing controls and human decision-making versus <em>replace</em> those controls and leave the model as the sole decision-maker.</li><li><em>“If this model fails, people may be mildly inconvenienced or embarrassed”</em> —&nbsp; Such systems include image classifiers, recommendation engines, and automated image manipulation tools. In my experience, companies significantly understate the potential downside for ML failures that, while only inconvenient to individual users, can carry significant PR risk in the aggregate. A company may think that failures in a shopping recommendation algorithm are “not a big deal” until the algorithm suggests highly inappropriate results to millions of users for an innocuous and very common query.&nbsp; Similarly, employees working on a face autodetection routine for a camera may think occasional failures are insignificant until the product is on sale and users discover that the feature fails to recognize faces with facial hair, or a particular hairstyle, or a particular range of skin color.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>I use this question to determine both the potential risk from an individual failure and the potential aggregate risk from a systemic failure.&nbsp; It also feeds back into my question about training data: some relatively minor potential harms are worth additional investment in training data and testing if they could inconvenience millions, or billions, of users or create a significant negative PR cycle for a company.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> This is the sort of question that gets people thinking about the importance of their model in the overall business. It can also be a helpful guide that companies invest in such a model, and the kinds of business processes that are amenable to models.&nbsp; Remember that models that work nearly perfectly can still fail spectacularly in unusual situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> We don’t always have the luxury of time or accurate foresight.&nbsp;Sometimes a business does not know how a model will be used: a model is developed for Product X and repurposed for Product Y, a minor beta feature suddenly becomes an overnight success, or a business necessity unexpectedly forces a model into widespread production.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What&#8217;s the cost of doing nothing?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> A consultant is an agent of change.&nbsp;When a prospect contacts me to discuss a project, I find it helpful to compare the cost of the desired change to the cost of another-change or even to the cost of the not-change. &#8220;What happens if you <em>don&#8217;t</em> do this?&nbsp;What costs do you incur, what exposures do take on now? And six months from now?&#8221;&nbsp;A high cost of doing nothing means that this is an urgent matter.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some consultants will tell you that a high cost of doing nothing is universally great (it means the prospect is ready to move) and a low cost is universally bad (the prospect isn&#8217;t really interested).&nbsp; I see it differently: we can use that cost of doing nothing as a guide to how we define the project&#8217;s timeline, fee structure, and approach. If the change is extremely urgent—a very high cost of doing nothing—it may warrant a quick fix now, soon followed by a more formal approach once the system is stable. A low cost of doing nothing, by comparison, means that we can define the project as &#8220;research&#8221; or &#8220;an experiment,&#8221; and move at a slower pace.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it:</strong> I will ask this one, flat-out, once a consulting prospect has outlined what they want to do.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> Besides helping to shape the structure of the project, understanding the cost of doing nothing can also shed light on the prospect&#8217;s motivations. That, in turn, can unlock additional information that can be relevant to the project.&nbsp;(For example, maybe the services I provide will help them reach the desired change, but that change won&#8217;t really help the company.&nbsp;Perhaps I can refer them to someone else in that case.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> Sometimes people don&#8217;t have a good handle on the risks and challenges they (don&#8217;t) face.&nbsp;They may hastily answer that this is an urgent matter when it&#8217;s not; or they may try to convince you that everything is fine when you can clearly see that the proverbial house is on fire. When you detect that their words and the situation don&#8217;t align, you can ask them to shed light on their longer-term plans.&nbsp;That may help them to see the situation more clearly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>How would we know we are wrong?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> This is something that was inspired from the intersection of an incredibly boring decision-science book and roadmap planning. Decision trees and roadmaps are very useful when building out the possible spaces of the future. However, for both decision trees and roadmaps we are usually overly optimistic in how we will proceed.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><em>We fail at properly considering failure.</em>&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>To appropriately plan for the future we must consider the different ways we can be wrong. Sometimes it will be at a certain decision point (“we didn’t get enough signups to move forward”) or an event trigger (“we see too many complaints”).&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If we consider this wrong-ness and the possible next step, we can start to normalize this failure and make better decisions.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it:&nbsp; </strong>It&#8217;s best to ask this when you find that certainty is at a high point for the project. More often than not, people don’t consider ways to detect that they need to change course.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> You build a map into the future based on what you can detect. This helps make hard decisions easier because you are effectively practicing the decision process before you are in the heat of the moment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> When things are currently going &#8220;wrong&#8221; it can be a sensitive subject for people. I’ve found it is easier to talk about how to get out of a current wrong situation than considering additional future situations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What upstream obligations do you have, and what downstream rights do you want to retain?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Shane</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> Imagine you employ a vendor to provide or enrich your training data, or you pay for consulting services related to ML.&nbsp;What happens to the information used by the vendors to build your product?&nbsp; Their downstream rights there run the gamut from “absolutely nothing” to “retaining a full copy of the training data, labels, trained models, and test results.” The median position, in my observation, tends to be that the vendor retains control of any new techniques and information derived from the work that would be useful <em>in general,</em> such as new methods of programmatically applying error correction to a trained model, but not the specific data used to train the model or the resulting trained model.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From the customer perspective, downstream rights are tied to competition/cost tradeoffs and the rights associated with training data.&nbsp; A company that considers ML a competitive advantage likely will not want their models or derivative data available to competitors, and they must balance this against the business consideration that vendors which retain downstream rights typically charge lower fees (because reselling that data or models can be a source of revenue). In addition, training data usually comes with contractual limitations and customers of ML services need to ensure they are not granting downstream rights that they don’t have in their upstream agreements. Finally, some kinds of training data, such as medical records or classified government data, may forbid unauthorized access or use in systems that lack adequate safeguards and audit logs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>This question is less relevant to companies that have an entirely in-house workflow (they generate their own training data, train their own models, and use models with their own employees and tools).&nbsp; It is highly relevant to companies that buy or sell ML services, use external vendors for part of their workflow, or handle sensitive data.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong>&nbsp; The notion of downstream rights is not a new question, nor is it specific to the ML world.&nbsp; Almost all vendor relationships involve delineating the intellectual property (IP) and tools that each party brings to the project, as well as the ownership of new IP developed during the project. Helping founders to recognize and establish those boundaries early on can save them a lot of trouble later.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> This is a question a company definitely wants to answer before they&#8217;ve provided data or services to a counterparty.&nbsp; These issues can be very difficult to resolve once data has been shared or work has begun.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>What if …? Then …?&nbsp; and What next?</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Q</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> A risk is a potential change that comes with consequences.&nbsp; To properly manage risk—to avoid those consequences—you need to identify those changes in advance (perform a risk assessment) and sort out what to do about them (devise your risk mitigation plans). That&#8217;s where this trio of questions comes in: <em>&#8220;What if?&#8221;</em> is the key to a risk assessment, as it opens the discussion on ways a project may deviate from its intended path.&nbsp; <em>&#8220;Then?&#8221;</em> explores the consequences of that deviation.&nbsp;The <em>&#8220;What next?&#8221;</em> starts the discussion on how to handle them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;<em>What if</em> … our data vendor goes out of business? <em>Then?</em>&nbsp;Our business is hamstrung.&nbsp;<em>What next?</em>&nbsp;We&#8217;d better have a backup data vendor in the wings.&nbsp; Or better yet, keep two vendors running concurrently so that we can switch over with minimal downtime.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>&#8220;<em>What if</em> … something changes, and the model&#8217;s predictions are wrong most of the time?&nbsp;<em>Then? </em>We&#8217;re in serious trouble, because that model is used to automate purchases.&nbsp;<em>What next?</em> We should implement monitors around the model, so that we can note when it&#8217;s acting out of turn. We should also add a &#8216;big red button&#8217; so that a person can quickly, easily, and completely shut it down if it starts to go haywire.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>&nbsp;Once we&#8217;ve sorted out what the client wants to achieve, I&#8217;ll round out the picture by walking them through some <em>&#8220;What if? Then? What next?&#8221;</em> scenarios where things don&#8217;t work out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it&#8217;s useful:</strong> It&#8217;s too easy to pretend the not-intended outcomes don&#8217;t exist if you don&#8217;t bring them up. I want my clients to understand what they&#8217;re getting into, so they can make informed decisions on whether and how to proceed. Going through even a small-scale risk assessment like this can shed light on the possible downside loss that&#8217;s lurking alongside their desired path. All of that risk can weigh heavily on their investment, and possibly even wipe out any intended benefit.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn&#8217;t work so well:</strong> The business world, especially Western business culture, has a strange relationship with positive attitudes. This energy can be infectious and it can help to motivate a team across the finish line. It can also convince people to pretend that the non-intended outcomes are too remote or otherwise not worth consideration.&nbsp;That&#8217;s usually when they find out, the hard way, what can really go wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How to handle this varies based on your role in the company, internal company politics, your ability to bring about change, and your ability to weather a storm.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h4>A random question</h4>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Source:</strong> Chris</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>The backstory:</strong> The most important question is one that isn’t expected. It is one that leads to unexpected answers. We don’t have dialog for dialog sake; we do it to learn something new. Sometimes the thing we learn is that we aren’t aligned.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I’ve found that the most unexpected thing is something that we wouldn’t choose based on our current thought process. Randomly choosing a question from a collection appropriate for your domain is really valuable. If you are building something for the web, what kinds of questions could you ask about a web project? This is helpful when the checklists of things to do get too large to try all of them. Pick a few at random.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You can take it a step further and pick questions from outside of your domain. This can simply be a list of provocations that require a high amount of interpretation by you to make sense. This is because randomness doesn’t work without the lens of human intuition.&nbsp;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Randomness without this intuition is just garbage. We do the work to bridge from random questions to some new idea related to our problem. We build the analogies in our mind even when something is seemingly not connected at first.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>How I use it: </strong>When you find that you keep asking the same questions. I have decks of cards like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblique_Strategies\">Oblique Strategies</a> for provocations, <a href=\"https://www.trytriggers.com/\">Triggers</a> for domain-specific questions, and others that can provide randomness. Domain-specific random questions can also be very impactful. Eventually, I expect models like GPT-n to provide appropriate random questions to prompts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>Why it’s useful:</strong> Even with all of the questions we ask to get out of bias, we are still biased. We still have assumptions we don’t realize. Randomness doesn’t care about your biases and assumptions. It will ask a question that you think on the surface is stupid, but when you think about it is important.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><strong>When it doesn’t work so well:</strong> With teams that are high on certainty they may think of the random question as a toy or distraction. The people I’ve found to be incredibly confident in their world trivialize the need to question bias. They will even try to actively subvert the process sometimes. If you hide the fact that a question was randomly chosen, it can go over better.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>In search of the bigger picture &#8230;</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If you&#8217;re collecting facts—names, numbers, times—then narrow questions will suffice.&nbsp; But if you&#8217;re looking to understand the bigger picture, if you want to get a meeting out of a rut, if you want people to <em>reflect</em> before they speak, then open-ended questions will serve you well.&nbsp; Doubly so when they come from an unexpected source and at an unexpected time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The questions we&#8217;ve documented here have helped us in our roles as an AI consultant, a product manager, and an attorney.&nbsp;(We also found it interesting that we use a lot of the same questions, which tells us how widely applicable they are.) We hope you&#8217;re able to put our favorite questions to use in your work. Perhaps they will even inspire you to devise and test a few of your own.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One point we hope we&#8217;ve driven home is that your goal in asking good questions isn&#8217;t to make yourself look smarter.&nbsp;Nor is it to get the answers you want to hear.&nbsp;Instead, your goal is to explore a problem space, shed light on new options, and mitigate risk. With that new, deeper understanding, you&#8217;re more prepared to work on the wicked problems that face us in the workplace and in the world at large.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/BiQVryBFH3A\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

In traditional software engineering, precedent has been established for the transition of responsibility from development teams to maintenance, user operations, and site reliability teams. New features in an existing product often follow a similar progression. For traditional software, the domain knowledge and skills required to develop new features differ from those necessary to ensure that the product works as intended. Because product development and product operations are distinct, it’s logical for different teams and processes to be responsible for them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In contrast, many production AI systems rely on feedback loops that require the same technical skills used during initial development. Similarly, in “<a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">Building Machine Learning Powered Applications: Going from Idea to Product</a>,” Emmanuel Ameisen states: “Indeed, exposing a model to users in production comes with a set of challenges that mirrors the ones that come with debugging a model.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As a result, at the stage when product managers for other types of products might shift to developing new features (or to other projects altogether), an AI product manager and the rest of the original development team should remain heavily involved. One reason for this is to tackle the (likely) lengthy backlog of ML/AI model improvements that will be discovered after the product engages with the real world. Another, of course, is to ensure that the product functions as expected and desired over time. We describe the final responsibility of the AI PM as <em>coordinating with the engineering, infrastructure, and site reliability teams to ensure all shipped features can be supported at scale.</em></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article offers our perspective into the practical details of the AI PM’s responsibilities in the latter parts of the AI product cycle, as well as some insight into best practices in execution of those responsibilities.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Debugging AI Products</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/bringing-an-ai-product-to-market/\">Bringing an AI Product to Market</a>, we distinguished the debugging phase of product development from pre-deployment evaluation and testing. This distinction assumes a slightly different definition of debugging than is often used in software development. We define debugging as the process of using logging and monitoring tools to detect and resolve the inevitable problems that show up in a production environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Emmanuel Ameisen again offers a useful framework for defining errors in AI/ML applications: “&#8230;three areas in particular are most important to verify: inputs to a pipeline, the confidence of a model and the outputs it produces.” To support verification in these areas, a product manager must first ensure that the AI system is capable of reporting back to the product team about its performance and usefulness over time.&nbsp; This may manifest in several ways, including the collection of explicit user feedback or comments via channels outside of the product team, and the provision of mechanisms to dispute the output of the AI system where applicable. Proper AI product monitoring is essential to this outcome.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>I/O validation</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>From a technical perspective, it is entirely possible for ML systems to function on wildly different data. For example, you can ask an ML model to make an inference on data taken from a distribution very different from what it was trained on—but that, of course, results in unpredictable and often undesired performance. Therefore, deployed AI products should include validation steps to ensure that model inputs and outputs are within generally expected limits, before a model training or inference task is accepted as successful.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Ideally, AI PMs would steer development teams to incorporate I/O validation into the initial build of the production system, along with the instrumentation needed to monitor model accuracy and other technical performance metrics. But in practice, it is common for model I/O validation steps to be added later, when scaling an AI product. Therefore, the PM should consider the team that will reconvene whenever it is necessary to build out or modify product features that:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>ensure that inputs are present and complete,</li><li>establish that inputs are from a realistic (expected) distribution of the data,</li><li>and trigger alarms, model retraining, or shutdowns (when necessary).</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The composition of these teams will vary between companies and products, but a typical cross-functional team would likely include representatives from Data Science (for product-level experimentation and inference task validation), Applied Science (for model performance and evaluation), ML Engineering (for data and feature engineering, as well as model pipeline support) and Software/Feature Engineering (for integration with the full stack of the AI product—such as UI/UX, cloud services, and dev ops tools). Working together, this post-production development team should embrace continuous delivery principles, and prioritize the integration of any additional necessary instrumentation that was not already implemented during the model development process.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Finally, the AI PM must work with production engineering teams to design and implement the alerting and remediation framework. Considerations include where to set thresholds for each persona, alert frequency, and the degree of remediation automation (both what’s possible and desired).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Inference Task Speed and SLOs</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>During testing and evaluation, application performance is important, but not critical to success. In the production environment, when the outputs of an ML model are often a central (yet hidden) component of a greater application, speed and reliability are critically important. It is entirely possible for an AI product’s output to be absolutely correct from the perspective of accuracy and data quality, but too slow to be even remotely useful. Consider the case of autonomous vehicles: if the outputs from even one of the many critical ML models that comprise the vehicle’s AI-powered “vision” are delivered <em>after</em> a crash, who cares if they were correct?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In engineering for production, AI PMs must take into account the speed at which information from ML/AI models must be delivered (to validation tasks, to other systems in the product, and to users). Technologies and techniques—such as engineering specifically for GPU/TPU performance and caching—are important tools in the deployment process, but they are also additional components that can fail, and thus be responsible for the failure of an AI product’s core functionality. An AI PM’s responsibility is to ensure that the development team implements proper checks prior to release, and—in the case of failure—to support the incident response teams, until they are proficient in resolving issues independently.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI product managers must also consider availability: the degree to which the service that an AI product provides is <em>available</em> to other systems and users. Service Level Objectives (SLOs) provide a useful framework for encapsulating this kind of decision. In an <a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli\">incident management blog post</a>, Atlassian defines SLOs as: “the individual promises you’re making to that customer… SLOs are what set customer expectations and tell IT and DevOps teams what goals they need to hit and measure themselves against. SLOs can be useful for both paid and unpaid accounts, as well as internal and external customers.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Service Level Indicators, Objectives, and Agreements (SLIs, SLOs, and SLAs) are well-known, frequently used, and well-documented tools for defining the availability of digital services.&nbsp; For cloud infrastructure some of the most common SLO types are concerned with availability, reliability and scalability. For AI products, these same concepts must be expanded to cover not just infrastructure, but also data and the system’s overall performance at a given task. While useful, these constructs are not beyond criticism. Chief among the challenges are: choosing the correct metrics to begin with, measuring and reporting once metrics are selected, and the lack of incentive for a service provider to update the service’s capabilities (which leads to outdated expectations). Despite these concerns, service level frameworks can be quite useful, and should be in the AI PM’s toolkit when designing the kind of experience that an AI product should provide.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Durability</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You must also take durability into account when building a post-production product plan. Even if well-designed, multi-layer fault detection and model retraining systems are carefully planned and implemented, every AI-powered system must be robust to the ever-changing and naturally stochastic environment that we (humans) all live in. Product managers should assume that any probabilistic component of an AI product will break at some point. A <em>good</em> AI product will be able to self-detect and alert experts upon such a failure; a <em>great </em>AI product will be able to detect the most common problems and adjust itself automatically—without significant interruption of services for users, or high-touch intervention by human experts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many ways to improve AI product durability, including:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/when-are-you-planning-to-retrain-your-machine-learning-model-5349eb0c4706\">Time-based model retraining</a>: retraining all core models periodically, regardless of performance.</li><li><a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/why-machine-learning-models-degrade-in-production-d0f2108e9214\">Continuous retraining</a>: a data-driven approach that employs constant monitoring of the model’s key performance indicators and data quality thresholds.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s worth noting that model durability and retraining can raise legal and policy issues. For example, in many regulated industries, changing any core functionality of an AI system’s decision-making capability (i.e., objective functions, major changes to hyperparameters, etc.) require not only disclosure, but also monitored testing.&nbsp; As such, an AI Product Manager’s responsibility here extends to releasing not only a usable product, but one that can be ethically and legally consumed. It’s also important to remember that no matter what the approach to developing and maintaining a highly durable AI system, the product team must have access to high quality, relevant metrics on both model performance and functionality.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Monitoring</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Proper monitoring (and the software instrumentation necessary to perform it) is essential to the success of an AI product. However, monitoring is a loaded term. The reasons for monitoring AI systems are often conflated, as are the different types of monitoring and alerting provided by off-the-shelf tools. Emmanuel Ameisen once again provides a useful and concise definition of model monitoring as a way to “track the health of a system. For models, this means monitoring their performance and the equity of their predictions.”</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The simplest case of model monitoring is to compute key performance metrics (related to both model fit and inference accuracy) regularly. These metrics can be combined with human-determined thresholds and automated alerting systems to inform when a model has “drifted” beyond normal operating parameters. While ML monitoring is a relatively new product area, standalone commercial products (including <a href=\"https://www.fiddler.ai/\">Fiddler</a> and <a href=\"https://www.superwise.ai/\">superwise.ai</a>) are available, and monitoring tools are incorporated into all the major machine learning platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Separate from monitoring for model freshness, Ameisen also mentions the need to apply technical domain experience in designing monitoring systems that detect fraud, abuse, and attack from external actors. AI PMs should consult with Trust &amp; Safety and Security teams to combine the best principles and technical solutions with existing AI product functionality. In some specific domains—such as financial services or medicine—no easy technical solutions exist. In this case, it is the responsibility of the AI product team to build tools to detect and mitigate fraud and abuse in the system.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As we’ve mentioned previously, it’s not enough to simply monitor an AI system&#8217;s performance characteristics. It is even more important to consistently ensure that the AI product’s user-facing and business purposes are being fulfilled. This responsibility is shared by the development team with Design, UX Research, SRE, Legal, PR, and Customer Support teams. The AI PM’s responsibility is again to orchestrate reasonable and easily repeatable mitigations to any problems. It is crucial to design and implement specific alerting capabilities for these functions and teams. If you simply wait for complaints, they will arise far too late in the cycle for your team to react properly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>No matter how well you research, design, and test an AI system, once it is released, people are going to complain about it. Some of those complaints will likely have merit, and responsible stewardship of AI products requires that users are given the ability to disagree with the system’s outputs and escalate issues to the product team.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It is also entirely possible for this feedback to show you that the system is underserving a particular segment of the population, and that you may need a portfolio of models to serve more of the user base. As an AI PM, you have the responsibility to build a safe product for <em>everyone</em> in the population who might use it. This includes consideration of the complexities that come into play with intersectionality. For example, an AI product might produce great outcomes for wealthy, American, cisgender, heterosexual, White women—and although it might be tempting to assume those outcomes would apply to all women, such an assumption would be incorrect. Returning to previous anti-bias and AI transparency tools such as <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993\">Model Cards for Model Reporting</a> (Timnit Gebru, et al.) is a great option at this point. It is important not to pass this development task off to researchers or engineers alone; it is an integral part of the AI product cycle.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If done right, users will never be aware of all the product monitoring and alerting that is in place, but don’t let that trick you. It’s essential to success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Post-Deployment Frameworks</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One question that an AI PM might ask when pondering these post-production requirements is: “This seems hard; can’t I just buy these capabilities from someone else?” This is a fair question, but—as with all things related to machine learning and artificial intelligence—the answer is far from a binary yes or no.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are many tools available to help with this process, from traditional vendors and bleeding edge startups alike. Deciding what investment to make in MLOps tooling is an inherently complex task. However, careful consideration and proactive actions often lead to defendable competitive advantages over time. Uber (the developer of <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/scaling-michelangelo/\">Michelangelo</a>), Airbnb (developer of <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata/strata-ny-2018/public/schedule/detail/68114.html\">zipline</a>), and Google have all taken advantage of superior tooling and operations skills to build market-leading AI products.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nearly every ML/AI library touts full end-to-end capabilities, from enterprise-ready stacks (such as <a href=\"https://www.h2o.ai/\">H20.ai</a>, <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLFlow</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.kubeflow.org/\">Kubeflow</a>) to the highly specialized and engineer-friendly (such as <a href=\"https://www.seldon.io/\">Seldon.io</a>) and everything in-between (like <a href=\"https://dask.org/\">Dask</a>). Enterprise level-frameworks often provide deep and well-supported integration with many common production systems; smaller companies might find this integration unnecessary or overly cumbersome. Regardless, it’s a safe bet that getting these off-the-shelf tools to work with your AI product in the exact ways you need them to will be costly (if not financially, then at least in time and human labor). That said—from a scale, security and features perspective—such capabilities may be required in many mature AI product environments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>On the other hand, building and scaling a software tool stack from scratch requires a significant sustained investment in both developer time and technology. Facebook, Uber, AirBnB, Google, Netflix, and other behemoths have all spent millions of dollars to build their ML development platforms; they also employ dozens to hundreds of employees, each tasked with building and scaling their internal capabilities. The upside here is that such end-to-end development to deployment frameworks and tools eventually become a competitive advantage, in and of themselves. However, it’s worth noting that in such environments, employing a single AI PM is not feasible. Instead, a cadre of PMs focused on different components of the AI product value chain are needed.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Where do we go from here?</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Building great AI products is a significant, cross-disciplinary, and time-consuming undertaking, even for the most mature and well-resourced companies. However, what ML and AI can accomplish at scale can be well worth the investment.&nbsp; Although a return on investment is never guaranteed, our goal is to provide AI PMs with the tools and techniques needed to build highly engaging and impactful AI products in a wide variety of contexts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In this article, we focused on the importance of collaboration between product and engineering teams, to ensure that your product not only functions as intended, but is also robust to both the degradation of its effectiveness and the uncertainties of its operating environment. In the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, a product release is just the beginning. Product managers have a unique place in the development ecosystem of ML/AI products, because they cannot simply guide the product to release and then turn it over to IT, SRE, or other post-production teams. AI product managers have a responsibility to oversee not only the design and build of the system’s capabilities, but also to coordinate the team during incidents, until the development team has completed enough knowledge transfer for independent post-production operation.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The evolution of AI-enabled product experiences is accelerating at breakneck speed. In parallel, the emerging role of AI product management continues to evolve at a similar pace, to ensure that the tools and products delivered to the market provide true utility and value to both customers and businesses. Our goal in this four-part series on AI product management is to increase community awareness and empower individuals and teams to improve their skill sets in order to effectively steer AI product development toward successful outcomes. The best ML/AI products that exist today were brought to market by teams of PhD ML/AI scientists and developers who worked in tandem with resourceful and skilled product teams.&nbsp; All were essential to their success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As the field of AI continues to mature, so will the exciting field of AI product management. We can’t wait to see what you build!</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Sources:</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li><a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/solutions/machine-learning/mlops-continuous-delivery-and-automation-pipelines-in-machine-learning\">MLOps: Continuous delivery and automation pipelines in machine learning</a> (Google)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomtaulli/2020/08/01/mlops-what-you-need-to-know/#43321e9b1214\">MLOps: What you need to know</a> (Forbes)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.atlassian.com/incident-management/kpis/sla-vs-slo-vs-sli\">SLA vs. SLO vs. SLI: What’s the difference?</a> (Atlassian) </li><li><a href=\"https://toddmorrill.github.io/blog/2019/10/05/MLOps-tooling\">MLOps Tooling</a> (Todd Morrill)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/building-machine-learning/9781492045106/\">Building Machine Learning Powered Applications</a> (O’Reilly)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-data-intensive-applications/9781491903063/\">Designing Data-Intensive Applications</a> (O’Reilly)</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Thanks</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We would like to thank the many people who have&nbsp; contributed their expertise to the early drafts of the articles in this series, including: Emmanuel Ameisen, Chris Albon, Chris Butler, Ashton Chevalier, Hilary Mason, Monica Rogati, Danielle Thorp, and Matthew Wise.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/PtjwTz5sgwY\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

That&#8217;s a good discussion to have, primarily because it forces us to think carefully about what we mean when we use words like &#8220;creativity&#8221; and &#8220;art.&#8221; As I&#8217;ve argued in the past, each time we have this discussion, we end up raising the bar. Each time an AI system does something that looks “intelligent” or creative, we end up deciding that’s not what intelligence really is.  And that’s a good thing. AI is likely to teach us more about what intelligence and creativity are not than about what they are.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I&#8217;m not terribly interested in whether AI can imitate human creativity. &#8220;Can an AI create a &#8216;new&#8217; poem that reads as if it were written by Keats, or a new piano sonata that sounds like Beethoven&#8221; isn&#8217;t a question that&#8217;s worth asking. Of course it can—if not now, it will be able to in the near future. We really don&#8217;t need a new Beethoven sonata; the 32 he wrote are enough. Nor do we need a new Keats ode, limited though his output was. Or a new Rembrandt. Imitation is ultimately a party trick: clever and amusing, but not really important. Sure, if you want texts for greeting cards or elevator music (or maybe even commercial pop), algorithms may do the trick.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What&#8217;s really important is the transition between different forms of creativity. How do you get something that&#8217;s qualitatively new, and not just imitation? Creativity isn&#8217;t about the artifacts as much as it&#8217;s about the transitions. How do you get from Bach to Haydn? How do you get from Haydn to Beethoven? And, even within the career of a single artist: how do you get from the beginning to the end? How do you get from Beethoven&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5dL-65mKe0\">first piano sonata</a>, which sounds like Haydn, to the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGg9cE-ceso\">last</a>, which at some points anticipates jazz? Artists aren&#8217;t stagnant. But I have no idea how even to ask whether an AI system can “mature” or “grow” in its output.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Great artists (and yes, I&#8217;m presuming a lot with the word &#8220;great&#8221;) frequently work by defining themselves against what came before. This is particularly clear with artists of the Romantic period in Germany, England, and France. The term <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanticism\">Romanticism</a> didn&#8217;t come around until some years later, but they left behind several manifestos describing what they were trying to do, and how it was different from what came before. That is still how artists work: Nnedi Okorafor&#8217;s <a href=\"http://nnedi.blogspot.com/2019/10/africanfuturism-defined.html\">Africanfuturism</a> is important as a way of defining and directing her own work. The importance of these defining statements isn&#8217;t so much about “rightness” (in the sense of &#8220;this is what art is or should be&#8221;) but in setting a direction for their project. Can a machine do that? Can it decide how its work will be different from what came before? It&#8217;s not clear to me that it can&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s a significant step beyond any machine learning projects we currently have.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Although artists work by projecting their work into the future, by defining something &#8220;new,&#8221; their work is also derived from what came before—possibly as misinterpretation, but almost always as revision. Listen to the Beatles, and you hear something that was really built on the backbone of blues, filtered through some British pop-cultural trends. At the end of the &#8220;His Dark Materials&#8221; trilogy, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Pullman\">Phillip Pullman</a> thanks all the authors he stole from. Or, as T. S. Eliot <a href=\"https://www.bartleby.com/200/sw11.html\">said</a>, “Immature poets imitate; mature poets steal; bad poets deface what they take, and good poets make it into something better, or at least something different.” Artists break from the past by reinterpreting that past.\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For AI-generated art&#8211;where does that sense of &#8220;different&#8221; come from? Can artificial intelligence learn to steal and reinterpret? Where does that engagement with history, current events and even selfhood come from?  Without that, there’s no basis for reinterpretation aside from random perturbation. It&#8217;s not clear that a sense of history couldn&#8217;t come from a big model trained on a gigantic corpus (although the best we can do now is <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/08/22/1007539/gpt3-openai-language-generator-artificial-intelligence-ai-opinion/\">build models that have no idea what they are saying</a>). What kind of model would take that corpus and make something that was different, something that hadn&#8217;t been seen before? Would we care if Hamlet wasn&#8217;t written by Shakespeare in a specific historical context, but in 2025 by a computer trained on an archive of Elizabethan politics, drama, and history? (Never mind that an archive of Elizabethan drama would be very skimpy; most plays from that period were never published.) Would anyone care about the opera <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_in_China\">Nixon in China</a> if it didn&#8217;t reflect a composer&#8217;s, and a librettist&#8217;s, thinking about historical events?\\n</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There&#8217;s another way in which I find computed-generated artworks unsatisfactory, particularly in music. AI-generated music is often interesting over the short term, but fails at larger-scale structure. Much of music history, from four-bar blues to Beethoven&#8217;s massive experiments in sonata form, is about building structures that can be interesting over the long term, whether &#8220;long term&#8221; means a few minutes of a blues song to several hours of opera. That was Beethoven&#8217;s project; more recently, it was the project of rock groups like Pink Floyd. It seems conceivable that a model could learn to generate such longer-form structures, but I&#8217;ve yet to see one that does it satisfactorily.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is this where collaboration between humans and machines comes in, and if so, what does that say about creativity? A machine could conceivably do the pattern-matching and combinatorics, assembling a creative work out of news clippings and stylistic mimicry. But a human still needs to supply the sense of history that makes the work something we care about. A human still needs to provide the structure that makes art works more than brief curiosities. Is it possible for a human could tweak a model like GPT-3 to give it that sense of direction and context? What kinds of user interfaces would facilitate this kind of interaction?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I can&#8217;t answer those questions, but that sounds like a much more interesting form of digital collaboration than having an algorithm write hundreds of dull poems or songs and “curating” a few that aren’t boring. That&#8217;s just a recipe for greeting-card sentiment and elevator music. I mean no disrespect to Hallmark—mass-produced poetry for greeting cards serves a purpose—but when we think about what kinds of creativity we want, and how that creativity will be mediated by AI, we should demand more.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/YrWZYgHiWmQ\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<h2>AI Benefits and Stakeholders</h2>\\n\\n\\n<p>AI is a field where value, in the form of outcomes and their resulting benefits, is created by machines exhibiting the ability to learn and “understand,” and to use the knowledge learned to carry out tasks or achieve goals. AI-generated benefits can be realized by defining and achieving appropriate goals. These goals depend on who the stakeholder is; in other words, the person or company receiving the benefits.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are three potential stakeholders for AI applications, with a single application often involving all three. They are business stakeholders, customers, and users. Each type of stakeholder has different and unique goals; each group is most interested in having their specific objectives met, or problems solved. My book, <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/ai-for-people/9781492036562/\"><em>AI for People and Business</em></a>, introduces a framework that highlights the fact that both people and businesses can benefit from AI in unique and different ways.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A typical social media platform needs to satisfy all three stakeholders. In the case of Twitter, the business stakeholder’s top goals are likely centered around profits and revenue growth. Customer stakeholders are the people and companies that advertise on the platform, and are most concerned with ROI on their ad spend. User stakeholders are interested in benefiting from the platform&#8217;s functionality: staying up-to-date, quickly finding new people and topics to follow, and engaging with family and friends.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Goals should be defined specifically and at a granular level for each stakeholder and relevant use case. Twitter has no doubt went through this exercise long ago; but if we imagine Twitter taking its first steps towards AI, some specific and granular goals could be to build a recommendation engine that helps users find the most relevant people to follow (a goal for users), while also building an AI-powered advertising targeting engine that best matches ads with those most likely to be interested in the product or service being advertised (for customers). This in turn would increase the platform&#8217;s value for users and thus increase engagement, which would result in more eyes to see and interact with ads, which would mean better ROI on ad spend for customers, which would then achieve the goal of increased revenue and customer retention (for business stakeholders). The key is to start with small and easily identifiable AI projects that will trickle value upwards towards a company’s highest priority goals.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>AI Goals as a Function of Maturity</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For companies early in their AI journey, setting appropriate goals helps create a foundation from which to build AI maturity. It also helps companies learn how to translate existing AI capabilities into solving specific real-world problems and use cases. In my book, I introduce the Technical Maturity Model:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ysS_w5yak3mxD14drl8SHqE9_de9IUqXb18lgIhjvDCbI65Vfie2jMcnKWtf4IxU_gw5MqJO5_tIqacnGZ4j7FneyYUFQ673sUdRlPyZodDy33fJ2o3nyHKPagON5zv5nr-qCgjx\" /></figure>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>I define technical maturity as a combination of three factors at a given point of time. These factors are:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul><li>Experience: More experience usually results in increased muscle memory, faster progress, and greater efficiency. Teams with more experience with techniques such as natural language processing and computer vision are more likely to be successful building new applications using the same techniques. They’re not new to the field; they’ve solved problems, and have discovered what does and doesn’t work.</li><li>Technical sophistication: Sophistication measures a team’s ability to use advanced tools and techniques (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, reinforcement learning, self-supervised learning). When new tools appear, they can decide quickly whether they’re worth while, and get up to speed. They’re on top of the research, and are capable of evaluating and experimenting with new ideas.</li><li>Technical competence: Competence measures a team’s ability to successfully deliver on initiatives and projects.\\xa0 They have previously built similar, successful AI applications, and are thus highly confident and relatively accurate in estimating the time, effort, and cost required to deliver again. Technical competence results in reduced risk and uncertainty.</li></ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There’s a lot of overlap between these factors.\\xa0 Defining them precisely isn’t as important as the fact that you need all three. Higher levels of experience, technical sophistication, and technical competence increase technical maturity. Increased AI technical maturity boosts certainty and confidence, which in turn, results in better and more efficient AI-powered outcomes and success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Technical maturity is a major factor behind why some companies are very successful with AI, while other companies struggle to get started and/or achieve success.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Challenge with Defining AI Goals</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Turning an AI idea into actual benefits is difficult and requires the “right” goals, leadership, expertise, and approach. It also requires buy-in and alignment at the C-level.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Identifying, prioritizing, and goal-setting for AI opportunities is a multi-functional team effort that should include business folks, domain experts, and AI practitioners and researchers. This helps ensure alignment with company goals, while also including necessary business and domain expertise. AI initiatives may also require significant considerations for governance, compliance, ethics, cost, and risk.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Further, while the technical details of AI are complex, the outputs of AI techniques are relatively simple. In most cases, AI solutions are built to map a set of inputs to one or more outputs, where the outputs fall into a small group of possibilities. Outputs from trained AI models include numbers (continuous or discrete), categories or classes (e.g., spam or not-spam), probabilities, groups/segments, or a sequence (e.g., characters, words, or sentences).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Therefore, AI techniques don’t just solve real-world problems out of the box. They don’t automatically generate revenue and growth, maximize ROI, or keep users engaged and loyal. Likewise, AI doesn’t inherently optimize supply chains, detect diseases, drive cars, augment human intelligence, or tailor promotions to different market segments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Setting a company-wide goal of reducing customer churn by 25% is great, but, unfortunately, is far too broad for most AI applications. That’s why customer churn reduction is not a natural output of AI techniques. The mismatch between goals like reducing customer churn and actual AI outputs must be properly handled and mapped.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Why and How to Set Good AI Goals</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI goals should be appropriate for a given company&#8217;s technical maturity, and should be chosen to maximize the likelihood of success, prove value, and build a foundation from which to create increasingly sophisticated AI solutions that achieve higher-level business goals. A crawl, walk, run approach is a good analogy for this.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Goals should be well-formed, meaning they are stakeholder-specific, map actual AI outputs to applications and use cases that achieve business goals, and are appropriately sized. For companies early in their AI maturity, appropriately-sized goals mean that they should be small and specific enough to experiment with, and prove potential value from, relatively quickly (think lean methodologies and incremental). As AI maturity increases, a non-incremental, holistic, and organization-wide AI vision and strategy should be created to achieve hierarchically-aligned AI goals of varying granularity—goals that drive all AI initiatives and development. This should be accompanied by a transition from incremental thinking to big vision, “<a href=\"https://www.innoarchitech.com/blog/applied-artificial-intelligence-ai-transformation-aipb-framework\">applied AI transformation</a>” thinking.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Let’s consider the overall goal of reducing customer churn. In an early stage of AI maturity, we can build AI solutions that reduce search friction (e.g., Netflix and Amazon recommendation engines), increase stickiness through personalized promotions and content that is more relevant and engaging, create a predictive model to identify customers most likely to churn and take appropriate preventative actions, or automate and optimize results in areas that are outside of a person’s primary area of expertise (e.g., automated retirement portfolio rebalancing and maximized ROI). When transitioning to developing a bigger AI vision and strategy, we may create a prioritized product roadmap consisting of a suite of recommendation engines and an AI-based personalized loyalty program, for example.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>At the individual goal level, and for each well-formed goal, the same multi-functional team mentioned earlier must work collaboratively to determine what AI opportunities are available, select and prioritize the ones to pursue, and determine the technical feasibility of each.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are frameworks like<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm\"> SMART</a> to help characterize well-formed goals, but since AI is a field that I characterize as scientific innovation (like R&amp;D), characteristics like being achievable and time-bound may not be the best goals. Results are typically achieved through a scientific process of discovery, exploration, and experimentation, and these processes are not always predictable.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Given the scientific nature of AI, goals are better expressed as well-posed questions and hypotheses around a specific and intended benefit or outcome for a certain stakeholder. With well-formed goals, data scientists and machine learning engineers can then apply the scientific method to test different approaches in order to determine the validity of the hypothesis, and assess whether a given approach is feasible and can achieve the goal.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, by introducing the “Frequently bought together” recommendations (and other recommendations), Amazon was able to increase average customer shopping cart size and order amount (i.e., up-sell and cross-sell), which in turn increases average revenue per customer, which in turn increases Amazon’s e-commerce generated revenue per quarter. <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/how-retailers-can-keep-up-with-consumers\">McKinsey estimates</a> that up to 35% of Amazon’s revenue and 75% of everything watched on Netflix comes from AI-powered recommendations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But when defining an AI project, the goal or hypothesis in this case isn’t to increase top-line revenue for the company, but rather to posit that building an application that groups products by likelihood to be purchased together will increase average customer order size, which in turn will have an upward impact on top level goals like increasing average revenue per customer and top-line revenue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another example would be setting a goal around building a well-performing AI model that can predict demand (number of units likely to be purchased) for a specific product for a given day, time, and weather conditions. If accurate, this prediction can help a retailer ensure that they do not run out of stock, which means that there is no lost revenue because a product is out of stock. An added benefit is improved customer experience, which results in happier and more loyal customers who are able to buy the products they want whenever they want to buy it. This same approach can be applied to virtually any other application of AI.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>AI and machine learning technologies have come a long way in terms of capabilities and accessibility, but off-the-shelf AI solutions aren’t yet available for specific industries or business domains, companies, sets of data, applications, and use cases. The key to success with AI is assembling a multi-functional team that defines appropriate goals, then letting these goals drive the AI initiatives and projects.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/gCrDHy2O2XE\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>In a conversation with Kevlin Henney, we started talking about the kinds of user interfaces that might work for AI-assisted programming. This is a significant problem: neither of us were aware of any significant work on user interfaces that support collaboration. However, as software developers, many of us have been practicing effective collaboration for years. It&#8217;s called pair programming, and it&#8217;s not at all like the models we&#8217;ve seen for interaction between an AI system and a human.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Most AI systems we’ve seen envision AI as an oracle: you give it the input, it pops out the answer. It’s a unidirectional flow from the source to the destination. This model has many problems; for example, one reason medical doctors have been slow to accept AI may be that <a href=\"https://phys.org/news/2018-01-people-dont-aihere.html\">it&#8217;s good at giving you the obvious solution</a> (&#8220;that rash is poison ivy&#8221;), at which point the doctor says &#8220;I knew that&#8230;&#8221; Or it gives you a different solution, to which the doctor says &#8220;That&#8217;s wrong.&#8221; Doctors worry that AI will “<a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2020/07/15/artificial-intelligence-patient-consent-hospitals/\">derail clinicians’ conversations with patients</a>,” hinting that oracles are unwelcome in the exam room (unless they’re human). </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Shortly after IBM&#8217;s Watson beat the world Jeopardy champions, IBM invited me to see a presentation about it. For me, the <a href=\"http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/02/watson-machine-learning.html\">most interesting part</a> wasn&#8217;t the Jeopardy game Watson played against some IBM employees; it was when they showed the set of answers Watson considered before selecting its answer, weighted with their probabilities. That level was the real gold.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t need an AI system to tell us something obvious, or something we can Google in a matter of seconds. We need AI when the obvious answer isn&#8217;t the right one, and one of the possible but rejected answers is.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What we really need is the ability to have a dialog with the machine. We still don&#8217;t have the user interface for that. We don&#8217;t need complete, perfect solutions; we need partial solutions in situations where we don&#8217;t have all the information, and we need the ability to explore those solutions with an (artificially) intelligent partner. What is the logic behind the second, third, fourth, and fifth solutions? If we know the most likely solution is wrong, what’s next? Life is not like a game of Chess or Go—or, for that matter, Jeopardy. </p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What would this look like? One of the most important contributions of Extreme Programming and other Agile approaches was that they weren’t unidirectional. These methodologies stressed iteration: building something useful, demo-ing it to the customer, taking feedback, and then improving. Compared to Waterfall, Agile gave up on the master plan and specification that governed the project&#8217;s shape from start to finish, in favor of many mid-course corrections.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That cyclic process, which is about collaboration between software developers and customers, may be exactly what we need to get beyond the &#8220;AI as Oracle&#8221; interaction. We don&#8217;t need a prescriptive AI writing code; we need a round trip, in which the AI makes suggestions, the programmer refines those suggestions, and together, they work towards a solution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That solution is probably embedded in an IDE. Programmers might start with a rough description of what they want to do, in an imprecise, ambiguous language like English. The AI could respond with a sketch of what the solution might look like, possibly in pseudo-code. The programmer could then continue by filling in the actual code, possibly with extensive code completion (and yes, based on a model trained on all the code in GitHub or whatever). At this point, the IDE could translate the programmer&#8217;s code back into pseudo-code, using a tool like <a href=\"http://www.phontron.com/paper/fudaba15asedemo.pdf\">&nbsp;Pseudogen</a> (a promising new tool, though still experimental). Any writer, whether of prose or of code, knows that having someone tell you what they think you meant does wonders for revealing your own lapses in understanding.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.05265.pdf\">MISIM</a> is another research project that <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/29/1005768/neural-network-similarities-between-programs-help-computers-code-themselves-ai-intel/\">envisions a collaborative role for AI</a>.&nbsp; It watches the code that a developer is writing, extracting its meaning and comparing it with similar code.&nbsp; It then makes suggestions about rewriting code that looks buggy or inefficient, based on the structure of similar programs. Although its creators suggest that MISIM could eventually lead to machines that program themselves, that’s not what interests me; I’m more interested in the idea that MISIM is helping a human to write better code. AI is still not very good at detecting and fixing bugs; but it is very good at asking a programmer to think carefully when it looks like something is wrong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Is this pair programming with a machine? Maybe.&nbsp; It is definitely enlisting the machine as a collaborator, rather than as a surrogate. The goal isn&#8217;t to replace the programmers, but to make programmers better, to work in ways that are faster and more effective.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Will it work? I don&#8217;t know; we haven&#8217;t built anything like it yet. It&#8217;s time to try.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Qo_8toOwdLA\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

And what does this mean for our purchase patterns and business models?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Welcome to Uncertainty</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>You&#8217;re used to a certain level of uncertainty in your life, sure.&nbsp; But the pandemic has quickly turned up the uncertainty on even basic planning.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your dishwasher, piano, or clothes dryer is making an odd sound. Do you proactively call a repair service to check it out?&nbsp; Your ounce of prevention will also cost you two weeks&#8217; wondering whether the repair technician was an asymptomatic carrier.&nbsp; If you hold off, you&#8217;re placing a bet that the appliance lasts long enough for treatment to become widely available, because you certainly don&#8217;t want it to break down just as infection rates spike.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Stresses on a system reveal that some of our constants were really variables in disguise.&nbsp; &#8220;I can always leave my house.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;I can get to the gym on Friday.&#8221;&nbsp; &#8220;If I don&#8217;t go grocery shopping tonight, I can always do it tomorrow.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not like they&#8217;ll run out of food.&#8221;&nbsp; These weren&#8217;t exactly bold statements in January. &nbsp; But by March, many cities&#8217; shelter-in-place orders had turned those periods into question marks. Even as cities are starting to relax those restrictions, there&#8217;s the worry that they may suddenly return as the virus continues to spread.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As this reality sets in, some of us are even weighing what we call &#8220;acceptance purchases&#8221;: items which show that we&#8217;re in this for the long haul.&nbsp; Your gym isn&#8217;t closed, but it&#8217;s <em>as good as closed</em> since the city can quickly order it to shut down if local case counts climb again.&nbsp; So maybe it&#8217;s time to buy that fancy exercise bike.&nbsp; And ride-hailing services were appealing until using them increased your exposure to the virus.&nbsp; Maybe now you&#8217;ll buy that car you sometimes think about?&nbsp; You had considered downsizing your home, but you&#8217;ll appreciate the extra space if you&#8217;re spending more time indoors.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Those sorts of purchases are meant to last you for years, though, which means they&#8217;re only wise investments if the pandemic (and its impact on the local economy) continues for a long time.&nbsp; What if we see improved prevention or widespread treatment within a few months?&nbsp; Do we want to try to offload an exercise bike or a car that we no longer need? The longer you hold off on making those decisions, the greater the chances that you&#8217;ll make those purchases too late.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It&#8217;s tough to make a decision when you can&#8217;t rely on your near-term world falling within some certain, predictable scope.&nbsp; You try to keep all of your options open at all times so that you can be ready for any possibility.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s a lot of extra strain on your brain.&nbsp; And it&#8217;s tiring.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Your house just got smaller</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The pandemic has made a number of businesses less desirable or outright inaccessible.&nbsp; Doing that work yourself reduces the impact around the uncertainty of when they&#8217;ll return.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also a lot more responsibility for you.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Congratulations on running a restaurant, cafe, bar, cinema, gym, school, daycare, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mvolpe/status/1294644899489419272\">office</a>, and storage facility.&nbsp; You get to buy workout equipment, cooking gear, hair care tools, teaching supplies, and anything else needed to backfill services to which you used to outsource. You&#8217;re responsible for the decisions on which models of equipment to buy, as well as the upkeep thereof. You suddenly need to know a lot of things about a lot of things, but you don&#8217;t have the time to become an expert in any one of them.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Welcome to the diseconomies of non-scale: being small and self-sufficient is expensive.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like a factory, hotel event space, or a fast-food kitchen, you find yourself constantly partitioning or re-tooling rooms to compensate for your limited space.&nbsp; The gym becomes the reading room becomes the video meeting space becomes the work area.&nbsp; (You and your spouse flip a coin to see who gets the <em>real</em> office and who gets that basement corner.&nbsp; Hint: if you want the nicer space, make sure you&#8217;re on more video calls. And pretend that you can&#8217;t get Zoom backgrounds to work.) The kitchen table flips between a dining area and a school, three times a day.&nbsp; The bathroom becomes the hair salon every week and quickly switches back again.&nbsp; All of these swaps take time, effort, and mental energy, what economists collectively refer to as <em>switching costs.</em>&nbsp; They add up. Quickly.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Nor is this just about the size of the home.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a matter of how much you were using it before the pandemic started, the number of spaces present, and the ratio of people to square feet.&nbsp; If you live in a sprawling, suburban house, but every room was already dedicated to some function or someone&#8217;s personal space, then you&#8217;re just marginally better off than the person occupying a small, urban apartment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This isn&#8217;t just about &#8220;working from home,&#8221; either.&nbsp; That usually means that you have a space set aside in your house to work and to take calls, and you have the house to yourself during working hours. Experienced remote-work professionals will tell you that <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dotmariusz/status/1287884297072852993\">we&#8217;re living a very different scenario</a>.&nbsp; This increasing need to run a standalone, be-everything home means that we are suffering from the curse of generalism: we&#8217;re our children&#8217;s teachers, our cooks, our housekeepers, our barbers, our IT department, and our fix-it crew.&nbsp; We&#8217;re becoming more self-sufficient, but at the expense of having less time to specialize in our main jobs. All of this means that we&#8217;re spending a lot of time just getting by, and not much time advancing.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Connections as Currency: Getting By and Getting Supplies</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In most places, you don&#8217;t need to be &#8220;connected&#8221; to get by day-to-day.&nbsp; Whom you know is less important because, with even a modest income, you can get most of what you need.&nbsp; You mostly care about diversifying your professional network, because that helps you to find a new job, which is what provides you the money that allows you to compensate for not knowing anyone else.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>When a pandemic triggers stresses in our supply chains, that idea breaks down.&nbsp; Whom you&nbsp; know in your <em>personal</em> sphere suddenly counts a lot more.&nbsp; Instead of money, it&#8217;s your social network that gets you through the day.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Do you know someone whose job gives them leading indicators on the spread of the virus?&nbsp; Early in the pandemic, friends of medical professionals got some advance warning of what was to come.&nbsp; They could gather information from their professional spheres to let their personal networks know that something nasty was brewing.&nbsp; The same holds for anyone whose business sells protective gear or cleaning supplies.&nbsp; Over casual drinks, they might mention: &#8220;It&#8217;s weird … we&#8217;re getting a lot of new orders, and not from our usual customers.&nbsp; Something&#8217;s up.&nbsp; You may want to buy some extras, just in case.&#8221;&nbsp; (This, by the by, shows the value of keeping an eye on your company&#8217;s data.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have systems to tell you when your sales numbers are abnormal, you may miss information that you already had in-hand.&nbsp; And in this case, it would have been time-sensitive info.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Communities of shared experience are home to these socially-strong yet professionally-diverse networks.&nbsp; Family and close friendships top the list, with religious and ethnic ties running a close second.&nbsp; (People who were part of the same wave of immigration from the same country often forge ties that are as strong as family.)&nbsp; Neighbors and people who share a hobby are also in there, though to a lesser degree. Within these groups there&#8217;s always somebody who has a quick tip, someone who &#8220;knows a guy,&#8221; someone you can pull aside for a quick &#8220;Hey can I ask you about …&#8221;&nbsp; Maybe your niece works at a big grocery chain, and she can tell you when the shipments of hand sanitizer arrive.&nbsp; In December, this would have been a trivial mention.&nbsp; Today, when goods are scarce, this is timely information and it can make a difference.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Personal networks often have the benefit of being geographically dispersed.&nbsp;Your best friend can ship you cleaning supplies, since they are plentiful in his part of the country.&nbsp; Your extended family, which stretches from Paris to Singapore, can tell you how their cities are handling shelter-in-place rules.&nbsp; Chatting with those far-flung aunts and uncles gives you several weeks&#8217; advance notice on how <em>your</em> city&#8217;s rules may turn out.&nbsp; That reduces your uncertainty, which makes it easier for you to prepare, which reduces your stress and decision fatigue.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Your ability to forge new relationships can compensate for a smaller social network.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t have a relative who works at Target, you can ask someone who works there, so long as you have the skill to spot <em>whom</em> to ask.&nbsp; You have to be able to read people, to see who would be receptive to that question. And you also need to tell whether this would be a simple favor, or something that merits monetary compensation.&nbsp; The value on that information just increased by a wide margin; shouldn&#8217;t the price follow?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Relationship-building also counts in the B2B setting.&nbsp; Such was the case with grocery chain Trader Joe&#8217;s.&nbsp; They&#8217;ve managed to avoid shortages during this pandemic, most notably in toilet paper.&nbsp; When other stores seemed to run out, Trader Joe&#8217;s always magically had some in stock.&nbsp; That&#8217;s because they were able to <a href=\"https://www.winsightgrocerybusiness.com/retailers/trader-joes-talks-supply-chain-tp-return-normalcy\">strike a deal with an unnamed hotel chain</a> to buy supplies that were going unused due to dramatic cuts in travel. Granted, Trader Joe&#8217;s very business model—white-labeling manufacturers&#8217; goods—smoothed this road.&nbsp; But their ability to forge that relationship counted just as much as their ability to execute on selling the goods.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Challenges to Come: Tracing the Chains</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We can reduce our pandemic-driven stresses by reducing the uncertainty.&nbsp; To do that, we can trace chains of knock-on effects to determine what changes are coming, and plan accordingly. &nbsp; For example:&nbsp; &#8220;many restaurants have closed up,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;there&#8217;s less waste from restaurants,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;there&#8217;s less food for rats,&#8221; therefore, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/us/cdc-coronavirus-rats.html\">expect rats to get more bold</a>.&#8221;&nbsp; So be careful when taking out your trash.&nbsp; &#8220;The pandemic has drastically cut air travel,&#8221; therefore &#8220;airlines will have less revenue,&#8221; therefore &#8220;airlines will furlough employees,&#8221; therefore &#8220;businesses those employees patronized—from in-airport restaurants to hotel shuttle services to their at-home economies—will suffer.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Though we can trace just one chain of effects at a time, multiple paths spin out of every <em>&#8220;what next?</em>&#8221; and spread out like a spider-crack in a window.&nbsp; They connect down the line to weave a fabric of impacts. Case in point: WSJ&#8217;s Scott McCartney points out that the sudden drop in air travel has <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-has-upended-everything-airlines-know-about-pricing-11596632998\">upset airlines&#8217; ability to set prices</a>, since they take such a data-driven approach. People who work in the ML/AI field will tell you that this is not just an airline problem: a sudden shift will upend <em>any</em> predictive models built on past behaviors, regardless of industry.&nbsp; That will affect <em>other</em> fields&#8217; dynamic pricing, yes, but also fraud detection (your credit card reflects a lot of outlier purchases, times, and locations since February) and demand forecasts (a knock-on effect of our collective outlier purchases).&nbsp; That, in turn, ties to inventory management, which is tied to supply chains, which involve all of the players in the shipping industry, which is tied to fuel consumption and vehicle maintenance&#8230;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>As with any tightly-coupled, complex system, all of these connections work in our favor until they suddenly don&#8217;t.&nbsp; Expect pandemic-related changes to cascade, revealing both endogenous and systemic problems that are related in unexpected ways.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One problem with tight coupling, Charles Perrow notes in <em>Normal Accidents</em>, is that materials only have one path to take through the system.&nbsp; If a component in the middle breaks, everything backs up so the entire system is as good as broken.&nbsp; You can repair or re-create the old paths (when possible) or create new connections between components.&nbsp; In Covid-speak, that means our long-term solutions fall into &#8220;partially restoring and re-thinking the pre-pandemic life&#8221; and &#8220;creating new ways to handle the day-to-day when there&#8217;s a highly infectious disease running around.&#8221;&nbsp; There are business opportunities in both camps.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Covid as a Forcing Function: New Opportunities To Handle Pandemic Life<img alt=\"™\" class=\"wp-smiley\" src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/12.0.0-1/72x72/2122.png\" style=\"height: 1em;\" /></h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We mostly assume the phrases &#8220;contactless&#8221; and &#8220;touch-free&#8221; refer to electronic payments.&nbsp; Those are very much in demand right now, but the touch-free space now extends to the wider notion of <em>strangers not interacting in-person, and not handling the same objects at the same time.</em>&nbsp; That opens the door to online learning, telemedicine, tele-anything.&nbsp; If you can provide your service at a distance, you have a lot of new prospects.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Entertainment already had a firm footing in the online world thanks to video streaming services. The pandemic, and its dramatically reduced cinema attendance, has provided them even more leverage as <a href=\"https://deadline.com/2020/07/universal-amc-theatres-theatrical-window-crush-pvod-agreement-1202997573/\">some movies will have a shorter time on the big screen</a> before they shift to online video.&nbsp; (As a side note, there&#8217;s another chain of knock-on effects to explore: since studios have been known to time releases to coincide with certain seasons and to have a better shot at industry awards, how will that change when films head into living rooms that much sooner?)&nbsp; Other groups, like Chicago&#8217;s Lyric Opera and New York&#8217;s Met Opera, are hosting performances online as their subscribers can no longer attend in-person.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Still, it&#8217;s become more difficult for performances that rely on people being in the same space. Stand-up comedians from Nimesh Patel to Dave Chappelle have recently been able to pull off outdoor gigs with live-but-socially-distanced audiences. Fire-spinning and belly-dance performer Dawn Xiana Moon, of Raks Inferno and Raks Geek, combined multiple streaming services to simulate all of her performers being &#8220;on-stage&#8221; at the same time. This required her to leverage her technology background, a skill set that is admittedly rare in the live-act world, and she&#8217;d still prefer a single platform that just works. By comparison, TV and movie studios have yet to explain how they will manage to film while keeping cast and crew socially distant. The bottom line is that companies that create tools to improve filming multiple, simultaneous, geographically-dispersed teams will have a lot of customers.&nbsp; (And for movies, will we see an increase in animation to fill the gap?)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>People are also demanding more of their home internet infrastructure to support increased school- and work-related loads.&nbsp; (The authors know several people who have shelled out to their ISPs for greater bandwidth.)&nbsp; That also means a greater load on mid-tier services like social media sites, videoconference services, and the aforementioned streaming video platforms.&nbsp; If you sell networking hardware or provide network operations services to those companies, you will have no shortage of work.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>If the pandemic continues long enough, we expect to see a deeper penetration of home broadband service, especially wireless broadband.&nbsp; This is another touch-free offering, as it permits your provider to establish and troubleshoot internet connectivity issues without sending a technician into your home.&nbsp; (As another knock-on effect, this means providers will be able to limit field technicians&#8217; service radius to their towers and datacenters, which should let them cover more territory on the same number of staff.)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Traditional, multi-year lease commercial real estate was already experiencing disruption due to coworking spaces.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll now both suffer as companies rethink their post-pandemic office needs.&nbsp; Doubly so since some newly-remote workers are <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/3/21277254/tech-silicon-valley-remote-work-exodus-facebook-google-coronavirus-future\">taking the opportunity to move out of state</a>. (Yet another knock-on effect: without office workers, what will happen to the lunch spots and bars that lined the dense urban-business landscape?)&nbsp; You also have <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/11/nyregion/nyc-economy-chain-stores.html\">retailers abandoning spaces</a> since there are far too few customers to browse stores. Two types of consumers may pick up that inventory, though.&nbsp; The first, in the short term, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/amazon-and-giant-mall-operator-look-at-turning-sears-j-c-penney-stores-into-fulfillment-centers-11596992863\">Amazon may convert some old mall spaces into distribution centers</a>. Other businesses will undoubtedly find ways to repurpose empty urban office spaces at deep-discount prices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Second, and in the longer term, we&#8217;ll accept that our homes are simply not large enough to be our Everything Place.&nbsp; People who choose to remain in dense urban environments will want their apartments to be more like standalone houses, which means having space for in-unit washer/dryer, multiple bathrooms, and multiple rooms to serve as offices. Perhaps cities will divvy up old office buildings into large apartments to meet that need.&nbsp; That&#8217;s admittedly more of a stretch, if for no other reason than the time scale involved for the construction effort and the zoning law changes.&nbsp; For now, some percentage of urban residents will simply pack up for the suburbs, or even more rural areas out of state. Let&#8217;s face it: if the restaurant scene has dwindled and public transit feels like too much of a coronavirus risk, then urban living has lost a lot of its luster.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Wherever we choose to live, we&#8217;ll need more support for running our homes.&nbsp; This will include ways to make the most of our limited space, such as smaller-scale workout equipment and compact storage, and increased support for DIY repairs, like video tutorials from manufacturers on how to service their products.&nbsp; This is another stretch, but if the pandemic lasts long enough, manufacturers will modify their products to make them easier to service.&nbsp; That, or cheaper to just throw away and replace when they encounter a problem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The difficulties of schooling don&#8217;t end with table space and bandwidth needs.&nbsp; There are also the socioemotional concerns such as college students learning how to live away from home, and how the K-12 set learns to socialize when they don&#8217;t interact in person.&nbsp; Not to mention, who will do the teaching?&nbsp; In March, when stay-at-home orders started to hit US cities, many parents suddenly had to balance their full-time jobs with being full-time teachers.&nbsp; (Technology consultants Sarah Aslanifar and Bobby Norton jokingly refer to their new roles as, &#8220;working from home-school.&#8221;)&nbsp; Businesses took a double hit as they had to scramble to find a way for people to work from home, and then those same people spent the next several weeks distracted during the workday.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Some parents have since formed social &#8220;pods&#8221; with neighbors whom they trust to perform compatible pandemic hygiene.&nbsp; Some of those have evolved into <em>educational</em> pods, wherein parents spring for someone to teach their group of kids.&nbsp; An article in MIT Tech Review mentions a <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/07/30/1005810/american-parents-are-setting-up-homeschool-pandemic-pods-microschool/\">price tag of $10,000 per student, per semester</a>.&nbsp; This isn&#8217;t accessible to everyone; but for high-earning parents, it&#8217;s a simple economic decision: the cost to outsource schooling is smaller than the amount of money they&#8217;ll earn when they can perform their day jobs at full capacity.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Higher education was already experiencing some disruption—boot camps and certificate programs on one end, and students questioning their post-college job prospects on the other—and the onset of the pandemic has increased the pressure.&nbsp; This goes beyond the last few months of sorting out whether and how to open campuses for autumn 2020.&nbsp; Parents and students alike also question the price tag of a fancy four-year college when students will be attending classes from their kitchen table.&nbsp; (One <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLLU3LvK_Hc\">SNL sketch</a> framed the experience as &#8220;University of Phoenix Online, with worse tech support.&#8221;)&nbsp; For the time being, colleges can busy themselves by shoring up courseware and videoconferencing platforms in order to set autumn 2020 classes in motion.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll quickly need to sort out other near-term concerns (shoring up lost profits from empty student housing) as well as their future prospects (demonstrating their value compared to vocational programs, especially if the job market suffers over the long term). &nbsp; If schools can&#8217;t sort this out on their own, they&#8217;ll likely pay someone to sort it out for them.&nbsp; There&#8217;s also a business opportunity in providing a centralized, one-stop SaaS platform such that colleges won&#8217;t have to cobble together their own with a mix of one-off tools.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One silver lining of working from home is that your job prospects just opened up.&nbsp; Covid-19 has forced a lot of companies to admit that the old &#8220;this work can&#8217;t be done from home&#8221; excuse doesn&#8217;t hold up.&nbsp; Some of them are even starting to <em>like</em> it: they see how much money they were burning on an office for people who already knew they&#8217;d be more effective working from home.&nbsp; Many of them will scratch that line item from next year&#8217;s budget.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This means we&#8217;ll see more remote hiring in the sectors that can support it.&nbsp; That will establish a clear boundary between the companies that see the benefits (&#8220;we&#8217;re now able to hire across the country for these hard-to-fill roles&#8221;) and those that do not (&#8220;we&#8217;re only hiring people who live in this city, for when we go back to the office&#8221;).&nbsp; Big tech-sector names like Google and Facebook have already announced plans to extend work-from-home support, while <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/12/twitter-tells-employees-they-can-work-from-home-forever.html\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/07/atlassian-tells-employees-they-can-work-from-home-indefinitely.html\">Atlassian</a> have flat-out said that their crews can work from home indefinitely.&nbsp; In some fields, failing to provide a remote-work option may limit your talent pool.&nbsp; It will be the equivalent of running an office space in the suburbs when most companies, and their prospective employees, exist in the dense urban center and have no desire to commute.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Bringing Back (Pieces of) &#8220;The Old Normal&#8221;</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Just as we&#8217;ll pay for help adapting to the current state of things, we&#8217;ll also pay for some semblance of &#8220;the old normal.&#8221;</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>People generally like meeting up, whether one-on-one for a tea or in larger groups for a party.&nbsp; We&#8217;re already using videoconferencing tools to hang out with friends and family, and to attend events.&nbsp; But we&#8217;re adapting to the tools more than the other way around.&nbsp; Right now services like Hangouts, Meet, and&nbsp; Zoom are still very much designed for, well, video versions of office conference calls: one person speaks at a time, and you get a &#8220;Brady Bunch&#8221; grid view of attendees.&nbsp; Expect the incumbent vendors as well as new upstarts to create tools that are better suited for [specific interaction]-over-video, like conferences, classroom teaching, or music lessons.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We&#8217;re really feeling this in online conferences.&nbsp; While webinar tools fulfill the mission of letting a person deliver a talk to a large number of attendees, they don&#8217;t support other aspects of an in-person event.&nbsp; Randomly bumping into people and &#8220;hallway track&#8221; sessions have forged long-term bonds between conference attendees, far more than the talks themselves.&nbsp; This could serve as a driver for VR, as that will take us away from &#8220;attending events from our living room&#8221; to &#8220;being in our living room, but actually attending events in a dedicated space.&#8221;&nbsp; There is a big difference.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Another reason people meet up is to play games.&nbsp; Online games are nothing new, and they&#8217;ve even gained some mainstream street cred thanks to casual gaming.&nbsp; Expect to see improved coordination, such that you can play with people of your choosing (a feature lacking in a number of iOS Game Center offerings).&nbsp; People playing more video games may also lead to greater participation in esports leagues, and even <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/business/video-game-meetings.html\">taking business meetings over a gaming session</a>.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In-person interaction is our most risky form of socializing at the moment, but it&#8217;s also the one people want the most. Goods and services that help us to (safely) meet face-to-face will not just help us on an emotional level, but they could play a key role in helping the economy get back on its feet.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We have masks and face shields, which are good for being in public.&nbsp; What about protective overgarments, reminiscent of 1950s interpretations of outer-space wear?&nbsp; We could wear them to protect our entire body in public transit or airplanes, and then shed them before entering a friend&#8217;s home.&nbsp; There&#8217;s also the down-to-earth business of designing and installing plastic shields between restaurant tables.&nbsp; Maybe someone will create transparent, oversized cabins that allow you and a few trusted friends to be &#8220;on the beach&#8221; but still be indoors and away from others.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Meeting in person also counts for office space.&nbsp; In a work-from-home world, some teams still prefer the in-person experience.&nbsp; What can we do to make it safer to be in the office, beyond standing several feet apart at all times?&nbsp; An effective but low-tech offering could involve installing protective shields around conference tables (not unlike what we see in some restaurants) or modifying office layouts to discourage crowding.&nbsp; The next step up would increase touch-free actions, such as choosing your elevator floor through a smartphone app.&nbsp; Larger and higher-tech offerings would go deep into the guts of the building to install virus purifiers in building HVAC systems and the accompanying ductwork.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>What Next?</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Where do we go from here?&nbsp; That depends how long we go without treatment or improved preventative measures.&nbsp; One thing&#8217;s for sure: Covid-19 is a driver of change.&nbsp; There is no more &#8220;normal&#8221; in terms of how we shop for groceries, attend events, or even lay out our homes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s up to us to adapt to our present, even as that present continues to change, and that will influence how we decide what to buy and sell.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>How much we change, as people, depends on how long the pandemic lasts.&nbsp; It&#8217;s possible that it will carve deep grooves in our collective social memory, similar to the Great Depression, and its impact will influence how people behave long after the disease is a threat.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It also depends on how much we are willing to adapt.&nbsp; That is a function of how soon we&#8217;re willing to let go of &#8220;normal,&#8221; which is really a euphemism for &#8220;the past.&#8221;&nbsp; Especially since the past is heavily mythologized.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/BvVhg_lRVhg\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",

That is, products that are laser-focused on one aspect of the data science and machine learning workflows, in contrast to all-in-one platforms that attempt to solve the entire space of data workflows.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>This article, which examines this shift in more depth, is an opinionated result of countless conversations with data scientists about their needs in modern data science workflows.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>The Two Cultures of Data Tooling</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Today we see two different kinds of offerings in the marketplace:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ol><li><strong>All-in-one platforms</strong> like Amazon Sagemaker, AzureML, Cloudera Data Science Workbench, and Databricks (which is now a unified analytics platform);<br /></li><li><strong>Best of Breed</strong> products that are laser-focused on one aspect of the data science or the machine learning process like Snowflake, Confluent/Kafka, MongoDB/Atlas, Coiled/Dask and Plotly.<sup>1</sup></li></ol>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Integrated all-in-one platforms assemble many tools together, and can therefore provide a full solution to common workflows. They’re reliable and steady, but they tend not to be exceptional at any part of that workflow and they tend to move slowly. For this reason, such platforms may be a good choice for companies that don&#8217;t have the culture or skills to assemble their own platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In contrast, best-of-breed products take a more craftsman approach: they do one thing well and move quickly (often they are the ones driving technological change). They usually meet the needs of end users more effectively, are cheaper, and easier to work with.&nbsp; However some assembly is required because they need to be used alongside other products to create full solutions.&nbsp; Best-of-breed products require a DIY spirit that may not be appropriate for slow-moving companies.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Which path is best? This is an open question, but we’re putting our money on best-of-breed products. We’ll share why in a moment, but first, we want to look at a historical perspective with what happened to data warehouses and data engineering platforms.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Lessons Learned from Data Warehouse and Data Engineering Platforms</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Historically, companies bought Oracle, SAS, Teradata or other data all-in-one data warehousing solutions. These were rock solid at what they did–and “what they did” includes offering packages that are valuable to other parts of the company, such as accounting–but it was difficult for customers to adapt to new workloads over time.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Next came data engineering platforms like Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR, which broke open the Oracle/SAS hegemony with open source tooling. These provided a greater level of flexibility with Hadoop, Hive, and Spark.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>However, while Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR worked well for a set of common data engineering workloads, they didn’t generalize well to workloads that didn’t fit the MapReduce paradigm, including deep learning and new natural language models. As companies moved to cloud, embraced interactive Python, integrated GPUs, or moved to a greater diversity of data science and machine learning use cases, these data engineering platforms weren’t ideal. Data scientists rejected these platforms and went back to working on their laptops where they had full control to play around and experiment with new libraries and hardware.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While data engineering platforms provided a great place for companies to start building data assets, their rigidity becomes especially challenging when companies embrace data science and machine learning, both of which are highly dynamic fields with heavy churn that require much more flexibility in order to stay relevant. An all-in-one platform makes it easy to get started, but can become a problem when your data science practice outgrows it.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>So if data engineering platforms like Cloudera displaced data warehousing platforms like SAS/Oracle, what will displace Cloudera as we move into the data science/machine learning age?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Why we think Best-of-Breed will displace walled garden platforms</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The worlds of data science and machine learning move at a much faster pace than data warehousing and much of data engineering.&nbsp; All-in-one platforms are too large and rigid to keep up.&nbsp; Additionally, the benefits of integration are less relevant today with technologies like Kubernetes.&nbsp; Let’s dive into these reasons in more depth.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Data Science and Machine Learning Require Flexibility</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>“Data science” is an incredibly broad term that encompasses dozens of activities like ETL, machine learning, model management, and user interfaces, each of which have many rapidly evolving choices. Only <em>part</em> of a data scientist&#8217;s workflow is typically supported by even the most mature data science platforms. Any attempt to build a one-size-fits-all integrated platform would have to include such a wide range of features, and such a wide range of choices within each feature, that it would be extremely difficult to maintain and keep up to date.&nbsp; What happens when you want to incorporate real-time data feeds? What happens when you want to start analyzing time series data?&nbsp; Yes, the all-in-one platforms will have tools to meet these needs; but will they be the tools you want, or the tools you’d choose if you had the opportunity?</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Consider user interfaces. Data scientists use many tools like Jupyter notebooks, IDEs, custom dashboards, text editors, and others throughout their day. Platforms offering only “Jupyter notebooks in the cloud” cover only a small fraction of what actual data scientists use in a given day. This leaves data scientists spending half of their time in the platform, half outside the platform, and a new third half migrating between the two environments.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Consider also the computational libraries that all-in-one platforms support, and the speed at which they go out of date quickly. Famously, Cloudera ran Spark 1.6 for<em> years</em> after Spark 2.0 was released–even though (and perhaps because) Spark 2.0 was released only 6 months after 1.6. It’s quite hard for a platform to stay on top of all of the rapid changes that are happening today. They’re too broad and numerous to keep up with.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h3>Kubernetes and the cloud commoditize integration</h3>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>While the variety of data science has made all-in-one platforms harder, at the same time advances in infrastructure have made integrating best-of-breed products easier.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Cloudera, Hortonworks, and MapR were necessary at the time because Hadoop, Hive, and Spark were notoriously difficult to set up and coordinate. Companies that lacked technical skills needed to buy an integrated solution.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>But today things are different. Modern data technologies are simpler to set up and configure. Also, technologies like Kubernetes and the cloud help to commoditize configuration and reduce integration pains with many narrowly-scoped products. Kubernetes lowers the barrier to integrating new products, which allows modern companies to assimilate and retire best-of-breed products on an as-needed basis without a painful onboarding process. For example, Kubernetes helps data scientists deploy APIs that serve models (machine learning or otherwise), build machine learning workflow systems, and is an increasingly common substrate for web applications that allows data scientists to integrate OSS technologies, as reported <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HamelHusain/status/1280344314741026817\">here</a> by Hamel Hussain, Staff Machine Learning Engineer at Github.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Kubernetes provides a common framework in which most deployment concerns can be specified programmatically.\\xa0 This puts more control into the hands of library authors, rather than individual integrators.\\xa0 As a result the work of integration is greatly reduced, often just specifying some configuration values and hitting deploy.\\xa0 A good example here is the <a href=\"https://zero-to-jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">Zero to JupyterHub guide</a>.\\xa0 Anyone with modest computer skills can deploy JupyterHub on Kubernetes without knowing too much in about an hour.\\xa0 Previously this would have taken a trained professional with pretty deep expertise several days.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We believe that companies that adopt a best-of-breed data platform will be more able to adapt to technology shifts that we know are coming. Rather than being tied into a monolithic data science platform on a multi-year time scale, they will be able to adopt, use, and swap out products as their needs change.&nbsp; Best of breed platforms enable companies to evolve and respond to today’s rapidly changing environment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The rise of the data analyst, data scientist, machine learning engineer and all the satellite roles that tie the decision function of organizations to data, along with increasing amounts of automation and machine intelligence, require tooling that meet these end users’ needs. These needs are rapidly evolving and tied to open source tooling that is also evolving rapidly. Our strong opinion (strongly held) is that best-of-breed platforms are better positioned to serve these rapidly evolving needs by building on these OSS tools than all-in-platforms. We look forward to finding out.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p></p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Footnote</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p><sup>1</sup> Note that we’re discussing data platforms that are built on top of OSS technologies, rather than the OSS technologies themselves. This is not another Dask vs Spark post, but a piece weighing up the utility of two distinct types of modern data platforms.</p>\\n<img alt=\"\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/GAPekrvmT6E\" width=\"1\" />'}],\n",
