On some level, our inner child is always saying: \"But that\\'s not fair.\" We know humans are biased, and it\\'s only in our wildest fantasies that we believe judges and other officials who administer justice somehow manage to escape the human condition. Given that, what role does software have to play in improving our lot? Can a bad algorithm be better than a flawed human? And if so, where does that lead us in our quest for justice and fairness?</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While we talk about AI being inscrutable, in reality it\\'s humans who are inscrutable. In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03731.pdf\"><em>Discrimination in the Age of Algorithms</em></a>, Jon Kleinberg, <em>et al.,</em> argue that algorithms, while unfair, can at least be audited rigorously. Humans can\\'t. If we ask a human judge, bank officer, or job interviewer why they made a particular decision, we\\'ll probably get an answer, but we\\'ll never know whether that answer reflects the real reason behind the decision. People often don’t know why they make a decision, and even when someone attempts an honest explanation, we never know whether there are underlying biases and prejudices they aren\\'t aware of. Everybody thinks they\\'re \"fair,\" and few people will admit to prejudice. With an algorithm, you can at least audit the data that was used to train the algorithm and test the results the algorithm gives you. A male manager will rarely tell you he <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/17/60percent-of-male-managers-now-say-theyre-uncomfortable-mentoring-women.html\">doesn\\'t like working with women</a>, or he can\\'t trust people of color. Algorithms don\\'t have those underlying and unacknowledged agendas; the agendas are in the training data, hiding in plain sight if we only search for them. We have the tools we need to make AI transparent–not explainable, perhaps, but we can expose bias, whether it’s hiding in the training data or the algorithm itself.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Auditing can reveal when an algorithm has reached its limits. Julia Dressel and Hany Farid, <a href=\"https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/4/1/eaao5580.full\">studying the COMPAS software</a> for recommending bail and prison sentences, found that it was no more accurate than randomly chosen people at predicting recidivism. Even more striking, they built a simple classifier that matched COMPAS’s accuracy using only two features–the defendant’s age and number of prior convictions–not the 137 features that COMPAS uses. Their interpretation was that there are limits to prediction, beyond which providing a richer set of features doesn’t add any signal. Commenting on this result, <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/01/equivant-compas-algorithm/550646/\">Sharad Goel</a> offers a different interpretation, that “judges in the real world have access to far more information than the volunteers...including witness testimonies, statements from attorneys, and more. Paradoxically, that informational overload can lead to worse results by allowing human biases to kick in.” In this interpretation, data overload can enable unfairness in humans. With an algorithm, it’s possible to audit the data and limit the number of features if that’s what it takes to improve accuracy. You can’t do that with humans; you can’t limit their exposure to extraneous data and experiences that may bias them.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Understanding the biases that are present in training data isn\\'t easy or simple. As <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.03731.pdf\">Kleinberg points out</a>, properly auditing a model would require collecting data about protected classes; it\\'s difficult to tell whether a model shows racial or gender bias without data about race and gender, and we frequently avoid collecting that data. In <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807v2.pdf\">another paper</a>, Kleinberg and his co-authors show there are many ways to define fairness that are mathematically incompatible with each other. But understanding model bias is possible, and if possible, it should be possible to build AI systems that are at least as fair as humans, if not more fair.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>This process is similar to the 19th-century concept of the \"<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeneutic_circle\">hermeneutic circle</a>.\" A literary text is inseparable from its culture; we can\\'t understand the text without understanding the culture, nor can we understand the culture without understanding the texts it produced. A model is inseparable from the data that was used to train it; but analyzing the output of the model can help us to understand the data, which in turn enables us to better understand the behavior of the model. To philosophers of the 19th century, the hermeneutic circle implies gradually spiraling inward: better historical understanding of the culture that produces the text enables a better understanding of the texts the culture produced, which in turn enables further progress in understanding the culture, and so on. We approach understanding asymptotically.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>I’m bringing up this bit of 19th-century intellectual history because the hermeneutic circle is, if nothing else, an attempt to describe a non-trivial iterative process for answering difficult questions. It’s a more subtle and self-reflective process than “fail forward fast” or even gradient descent. And awareness of the process is important. AI won’t bring us an epiphany in which our tools suddenly set aside years of biased and prejudiced history. That’s what we thought when we “moved fast and broke things”: we thought we could non-critically invent ourselves out of a host of social ills. That didn’t happen. If we can get on a path toward doing better, we are doing well. And that path certainly entails a more complex understanding of how to make progress. We shouldn\\'t ask our AI tools to be fair; instead, we should ask them to be less unfair and be willing to iterate until we see improvement. If we can make progress through several possibly painful iterations, we approach the center.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The hermeneutic circle also reminds us that understanding comes from looking at both the particular and the general: the text and the context. That is particularly important when we’re dealing with data and with AI. It is very easy for human subjects to become abstractions–rows in a database that are assigned a score, like the probability of committing a crime. When we don’t resist that temptation, when we allow ourselves to be ruled by abstractions rather than remembering our abstractions represent people, we will never be “fair”: we’ve lost track of what fair means. It’s impossible to be fair to a table in a database. Fairness is always about individuals.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We\\'re right to be skeptical. First, European thought has been plagued by the notion that European culture is the goal of human history. “Move fast and break things” is just another version of that delusion: we’re smart, we’re technocrats, we’re the culmination of history, of course we’ll get it right. If our understanding of \"fairness\" degenerates into an affirmation of what we already are, we are in trouble. It\\'s dangerous to put too much faith in our ability to perform audits and develop metrics: it\\'s easy to game the system, and it\\'s easy to trick yourself into believing you\\'ve achieved something you haven\\'t. I’m encouraged, though, by the idea that the hermeneutic circle is a way of getting things right by being slightly less wrong. It’s a framework that demands humility and dialog. For that dialog to work, it must take into account the present and the past, the individual and the collective data, the disenfranchised and the franchised.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Second, we have to avoid turning the process of fairness into a game: a circle where you\\'re endlessly chasing your tail. It\\'s easy to celebrate the process of circling while forgetting that the goal isn\\'t publishing papers and doing experiments. It’s easy to say “we’re not making any progress, and we probably can’t make any progress, but at least our salaries are being paid and we’re doing interesting work.” It’s easy to play the circle game when it can be proven different definitions of fairness are <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05807v2.pdf\">incompatible</a>, or when contemplating the enormous number of dimensions in which one might want to be fair. And we will have to admit that fairness is not an absolute concept that’s graven on stone tablets, but that is fundamentally situational.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>It was easy for the humanistic project of interpretation to lose itself in the circle game because it never had tools like audits and metrics. It could never measure whether it was getting closer to its goal, and when you can\\'t measure your progress, it\\'s easy to get lost. But we can measure disenfranchisement, and we can ensure that marginalized people are included in our conversations, so we understand what being \"fair\" means to people who are outside the system. As Cathy O\\'Neil has suggested, we can <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/611113/a-new-company-audits-algorithms-to-see-how-biased-they-are/\">perform audits</a> to black-box systems. We can understand fairness will always be <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/the-problem-with-building-a-fair-system\">elusive and aspirational</a>, and use that knowledge to build appeal and redress into our systems. We can\\'t let the ideal of perfect fairness become an excuse for inaction. We can make incremental progress toward building a world that\\'s better for all of us.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>We\\'ll never finish that project, in part because the issues we\\'re tracking will always be changing, and our old problems will mutate to plague us in new ways. We’ll never be done because we will have to deal with messy questions like what “fair” means in any given context, and those contexts will change constantly.

In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">a survey</a> we released earlier this year, we found that more than 60% of respondents worked in organizations that planned to invest some of their IT budgets into AI. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-adoption-is-being-fueled-by-an-improved-tool-ecosystem\">We also found</a> that the level of investment depended on how much experience a company already had with AI technologies, with companies further along the maturity curve planning substantially higher investments. As far as current levels of adoption, the answer depended on the industry sector. We found that in several industries, 30% or more of respondents described their organizations as having a mature AI practice:</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-31Vik\"><img alt=\"Stage of adoption of AI technologies\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-2ac6f48acbec09780f5afd507a463571.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">Stage of adoption of AI technologies</a> (by industry).

Recall that the rise of big data and data science necessitated a certain amount of retraining across an entire organization: technologists and analysts needed to familiarize themselves with new tools and architectures, but business experts and managers also needed to reorient their workflows to adjust to data-driven processes and data-intensive systems. AI and machine learning will require a similar holistic approach to training. Here are a few reasons why:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>As noted from our survey, identifying appropriate business use cases remains an ongoing challenge. Domain experts and business owners need to develop an understanding of these technologies in order to be able to highlight areas where they are likely to make an impact within a company.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Members of an organization will need to understand—even at a high-level—the current state of AI and ML technologies so they know the strengths and limitations of these new tools. For instance, in the case of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robotic_process_automation\">robotic process automation (RPA)</a>, it’s really the people closest to tasks (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/timoreilly/status/1111421767216562176\">“bottoms up”</a>) who can best identify areas where it is most suitable.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>AI and machine learning depend on data (usually labeled training data for machine learning models), and in many instances, a certain amount of domain knowledge will be needed to assemble high-quality data.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Machine learning and AI involve end-to-end pipelines, so development/testing/integration will often cut across technical roles and technical teams.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>AI and machine learning applications and solutions often interact with (or augment) users and domain experts, so UX/design remains critical.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>\\r\\n<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/how-machine-learning-impacts-information-security\">Security</a>, privacy, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/why-its-hard-to-design-fair-machine-learning-models\">ethics</a>, and other <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">risk and compliance issues</a> will increasingly require that companies set up <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning-models\">cross-functional teams</a> when they build AI and machine learning systems and products.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>At our upcoming <a href=\"http://theaiconf.com\">Artificial Intelligence conferences</a> in <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca\">San Jose</a> and <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-eu\">London</a>, we have assembled a roster of two-day training sessions, tutorials, and presentations to help individuals (across job roles and functions) sharpen their skills and understanding of AI and machine learning. We return to San Jose with a two-day <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/artificial-intelligence/ai-ca/public/schedule/topic/3035\">Business Summit</a> designed specifically for executives, business leaders, and strategists.

Hence, we draw conclusions about the promise and limitations of probabilistic programming for end-users.</i>\\r\\n</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n<p>Continue reading <a href=\\'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/four-short-links-20-june-2019\\'>Four short links: 20 June 2019.</a></p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/A2jREqLuZDI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>', 'links': [{'href': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/A2jREqLuZDI/four-short-links-20-june-2019', 'rel': 'alternate', 'type': 'text/html'}], 'authors': [{'name': 'Nat Torkington'}], 'author_detail': {'name': 'Nat Torkington'}, 'author': 'Nat Torkington', 'feedburner_origlink': 'https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/four-short-links-20-june-2019'}, {'title': 'Enabling end-to-end machine learning pipelines in real-world applications', 'title_detail': {'type': 'text/plain', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': 'Enabling end-to-end machine learning pipelines in real-world applications'}, 'updated': '2019-06-20T11:50:00Z', 'updated_parsed': time.struct_time(tm_year=2019, tm_mon=6, tm_mday=20, tm_hour=11, tm_min=50, tm_sec=0, tm_wday=3, tm_yday=171, tm_isdst=0), 'id': 'tag:www.oreilly.com,2019-06-20:/ideas/enabling-end-to-end-machine-learning-pipelines-in-real-world-applications', 'guidislink': True, 'link': 'http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/AFtNwYXYS-k/enabling-end-to-end-machine-learning-pipelines-in-real-world-applications', 'content': [{'type': 'text/html', 'language': None, 'base': 'http://feeds.feedburner.com/oreilly/radar/atom', 'value': '<p><img src=\\'https://d3ucjech6zwjp8.cloudfront.net/600x450/human-3131802_1920_crop-33c2a3112f5b03022265c1aa7cc180bc.jpg\\'/></p><p><em>The O’Reilly Data Show Podcast: Nick Pentreath on overcoming challenges in productionizing machine learning models.</em></p><p>In this episode of the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/topics/oreilly-data-show-podcast\">Data Show</a>, I spoke with <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/mlnick/?originalSubdomain=za\">Nick Pentreath</a>, principal engineer at IBM.

A few factors are contributing to this strong interest in implementing ML in products and services. First, the machine learning community has conducted groundbreaking research in many areas of interest to companies, and much of this research has been conducted out in the open via preprints and conference presentations. We are also beginning to see researchers <a href=\"https://github.com/allenai/allennlp\">share sample code</a> written in popular open source libraries, and some even <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/bert\">share pre-trained models</a>. Organizations now also have more use cases and case studies from which to draw inspiration—no matter what industry or domain you are interested in, chances are there are many interesting ML applications you can learn from. Finally, modeling tools are improving, and automation is beginning to allow new users to tackle problems that used to be the province of experts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With the shift toward the <em>implementation</em> of machine learning, it’s natural to expect improvement in tools targeted at helping companies with ML. In previous posts, we’ve outlined the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">foundational technologies needed to sustain machine learning</a> within an organization, and there are early signs that <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">tools for model development and model governance</a> are beginning to gain users.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6YOix\"><img alt=\"ml tools\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-628368c0c328affc33c99503832b5e31.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A collection of tools that focus primarily on aspects of model development, governance, and operations. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Model development</h2>\\n\\n<p>One sure sign that companies are getting serious about machine learning is the growing popularity of tools designed specifically for managing the ML model <em>development </em>lifecycle, such as <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comet.ml/\">Comet.ml</a>. Why aren’t traditional software tools sufficient? In a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">previous post</a>, we noted some key attributes that distinguish a machine learning project:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Unlike traditional software where the goal is to meet a functional specification, in ML the goal is to optimize a metric.</li>\\n\\t<li>Quality depends not just on code, but also on data, tuning, regular updates, and retraining.</li>\\n\\t<li>Those involved with ML usually want to experiment with new libraries, algorithms, and data sources—and thus, one must be able to put those new components into production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">growth in adoption of tools like MLflow</a> indicates that new tools are in fact very much needed. These ML development tools are designed specifically to help teams of developers, <a href=\"https://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2019/03/28/machine-learning-engineer-is-the-best-job-in-the-u-s-according-to-indeed/\">machine learning engineers</a>, and data scientists collaborate, manage, and <em>reproduce</em>, ML experiments. Many tools in this category let users to systematically conduct modeling experiments (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UADvHfcMJek\">NAS</a>) while emphasizing the ease with which one can manage, track, and reproduce such experiments.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Model governance</h2>\\n\\n<p>We are also beginning to come across companies that acknowledge the need for model <em>governance</em> tools and capabilities. Just as companies have long treated data as assets, as ML becomes more central to an organization’s operations, models will be treated as important assets. More precisely, models built or tuned for specific applications (in reality, this means <em>models + data</em>) <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">will need to be managed and protected</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>A database for authorization and security: who has read/write access to certain models</li>\\n\\t<li>A catalog or a database that lists models, including when they were tested, trained, and deployed</li>\\n\\t<li>A catalog of validation data sets and the accuracy measurements of stored models</li>\\n\\t<li>Versioning (of models, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)\">feature vectors</a>, data) and the ability to roll out, roll back, or have multiple live versions</li>\\n\\t<li>Metadata and artifacts needed for a full audit trail</li>\\n\\t<li>Who approved and pushed the model out to production, who is able to monitor its performance and receive alerts, and who is responsible for it</li>\\n\\t<li>A dashboard that provides custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, business owners)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Model operations, testing, and monitoring</h2>\\n\\n<p>As machine learning proliferates in products and services, we need a set of roles, best practices, and tools to deploy, manage, test, and monitor ML in real-world production settings. There are some initial tools aimed at model operations and testing—mainly for deploying and <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441\">monitoring ML</a><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441\"> models</a>—but it’s clear we are still in the early stages for solutions in these areas.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are three <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">common issues that diminish the value of ML models</a> once they’re in production. The first is <em>concept drift</em>: the accuracy of models in production degrades over time, because of changes in the real world, stemming from a growing disparity between the data they were trained on and the data they are used on. The second is <em>locality</em>: when deploying models to new geographic locations, user demographics, or business customers, it’s often not the case that pre-trained models work at the expected level of accuracy. Measuring online accuracy per customer / geography / demographic group is important both to monitor bias and to ensure accuracy for a growing customer base. The third is <em>data quality</em>: since ML models are more sensitive to the semantics of incoming data, changes in data distribution that are often missed by traditional data quality tools wreak havoc on models’ accuracy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Beyond the need to monitor that your current deployed models operate as intended, another challenge is knowing that a newly proposed model actually delivers better performance in production. Some <a href=\"https://www.datatron.com/\">early systems</a> allow for the comparison of an “incumbent model” against “challenger models,” including having challengers in “dark launch” or “offline” mode (this means challenger models are evaluated on production traffic but haven’t been deployed to production). Other noteworthy items include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Tools for continuous integration and continuous testing of models. A model is not “correct” if it returns a valid value—it has to meet an accuracy bar. There needs to be a way to validate this against a given metric and validation set before deploying a model.</li>\\n\\t<li>Online measurement of the accuracy of each model (what’s the accuracy that users are experiencing “in the field”?). Related to this is the need to monitor bias, locality effects, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">related risks</a>. For example, scores often need to be broken down by demographics (are men and women getting similar accuracy?) or locales (are German and Spanish users getting similar accuracy?).</li>\\n\\t<li>The ability to manage the quality of service for model inference to different customers, including rate limiting, request size limiting, metering, bot detection, and IP geo-fencing.</li>\\n\\t<li>Ability to scale (and auto-scale), secure, monitor, and troubleshoot live models. Scaling has two dimensions—the size of the traffic hitting the models and the number of models that need to be evaluated.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Model operations and testing is very much still a nascent field where systematic checklists are just beginning to be assembled. An overview from a <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf\">2017 paper from Google</a> lets us gauge how much tooling is still needed for model operations and testing. This paper came with a <em>28-item checklist</em> that detailed things that need to be accounted for in order to have a reliable, production-grade machine learning system:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Features and data</strong>: seven items that include checks for privacy controls, feature validation, exploring the necessity and cost of a feature, and other data-related tests.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Tests for model development</strong>: seven sanity checks, including checking whether a simpler model will suffice, model performance on critical data slices (e.g., region, age, recency, frequency, etc.), the impact of model staleness, and other important considerations.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Infrastructure tests</strong>: a suite of seven considerations, including the reproducibility of model training, the ease with which models can be rolled back, integration tests on end-to-end model pipelines, model tests via a <a href=\"https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/canary-canary-testing\">canary process</a>.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Monitoring</strong>: the authors list a series of seven items to ensure models are working as expected. This includes tests for <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">model staleness</a>, performance metrics (training, inference, throughput), validating that training and serving code generate similar values, and other essential items.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>New roles</h2>\\n\\n<p>Discussions around machine learning tend to revolve around the work of data scientists and model building experts. This is beginning to change now that many companies are entering the implementation phase for their ML initiatives. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">Machine learning engineers</a>, data engineers, developers, and domain experts are critical to the success of ML projects. At the moment, few (if any) teams have checklists as extensive as the one detailed in the <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf\">2017 paper from Google</a>. The task of building real-world production-grade ML models still requires stitching together tools and teams that cut across many functional areas. However, as tools for model governance and model operations and testing begin to get refined and become more widely available, it’s likely that specialists (an “ML ops team”) will be tasked to use such tools. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">Automation</a> will also be an important component, as these tools will need to enable organizations to build, manage, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-to-build-machine-learning-tools-to-augment-machine-learning-engineers\">monitor many more machine learning models</a>.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6LDiA\"><img alt=\"Demand for tools for managing ML in the enterprise\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-c9a455c660bff61358774ec606b9b739.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Demand for tools for managing ML in the enterprise.

Tools like MLflow are being used to track and manage machine learning experiments (mainly offline, using test data).

A few factors are contributing to this strong interest in implementing ML in products and services. First, the machine learning community has conducted groundbreaking research in many areas of interest to companies, and much of this research has been conducted out in the open via preprints and conference presentations. We are also beginning to see researchers <a href=\"https://github.com/allenai/allennlp\">share sample code</a> written in popular open source libraries, and some even <a href=\"https://github.com/google-research/bert\">share pre-trained models</a>. Organizations now also have more use cases and case studies from which to draw inspiration—no matter what industry or domain you are interested in, chances are there are many interesting ML applications you can learn from. Finally, modeling tools are improving, and automation is beginning to allow new users to tackle problems that used to be the province of experts.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With the shift toward the <em>implementation</em> of machine learning, it’s natural to expect improvement in tools targeted at helping companies with ML. In previous posts, we’ve outlined the <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/becoming-a-machine-learning-company-means-investing-in-foundational-technologies\">foundational technologies needed to sustain machine learning</a> within an organization, and there are early signs that <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">tools for model development and model governance</a> are beginning to gain users.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6YOix\"><img alt=\"ml tools\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure1-628368c0c328affc33c99503832b5e31.jpg\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 1. </span>A collection of tools that focus primarily on aspects of model development, governance, and operations. Source: Ben Lorica.</figcaption></figure>\\n\\n\\n<h2>Model development</h2>\\n\\n<p>One sure sign that companies are getting serious about machine learning is the growing popularity of tools designed specifically for managing the ML model <em>development </em>lifecycle, such as <a href=\"https://mlflow.org/\">MLflow</a> and <a href=\"https://www.comet.ml/\">Comet.ml</a>. Why aren’t traditional software tools sufficient? In a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">previous post</a>, we noted some key attributes that distinguish a machine learning project:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Unlike traditional software where the goal is to meet a functional specification, in ML the goal is to optimize a metric.</li>\\n\\t<li>Quality depends not just on code, but also on data, tuning, regular updates, and retraining.</li>\\n\\t<li>Those involved with ML usually want to experiment with new libraries, algorithms, and data sources—and thus, one must be able to put those new components into production.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">growth in adoption of tools like MLflow</a> indicates that new tools are in fact very much needed. These ML development tools are designed specifically to help teams of developers, <a href=\"https://softwarestrategiesblog.com/2019/03/28/machine-learning-engineer-is-the-best-job-in-the-u-s-according-to-indeed/\">machine learning engineers</a>, and data scientists collaborate, manage, and <em>reproduce</em>, ML experiments. Many tools in this category let users to systematically conduct modeling experiments (e.g., hyperparameter tuning, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UADvHfcMJek\">NAS</a>) while emphasizing the ease with which one can manage, track, and reproduce such experiments.</p>\\n\\n<h2>Model governance</h2>\\n\\n<p>We are also beginning to come across companies that acknowledge the need for model <em>governance</em> tools and capabilities. Just as companies have long treated data as assets, as ML becomes more central to an organization’s operations, models will be treated as important assets. More precisely, models built or tuned for specific applications (in reality, this means <em>models + data</em>) <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/specialized-tools-for-machine-learning-development-and-model-governance-are-becoming-essential\">will need to be managed and protected</a>:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>A database for authorization and security: who has read/write access to certain models</li>\\n\\t<li>A catalog or a database that lists models, including when they were tested, trained, and deployed</li>\\n\\t<li>A catalog of validation data sets and the accuracy measurements of stored models</li>\\n\\t<li>Versioning (of models, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_(machine_learning)\">feature vectors</a>, data) and the ability to roll out, roll back, or have multiple live versions</li>\\n\\t<li>Metadata and artifacts needed for a full audit trail</li>\\n\\t<li>Who approved and pushed the model out to production, who is able to monitor its performance and receive alerts, and who is responsible for it</li>\\n\\t<li>A dashboard that provides custom views for all principals (operations, ML engineers, data scientists, business owners)</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>Model operations, testing, and monitoring</h2>\\n\\n<p>As machine learning proliferates in products and services, we need a set of roles, best practices, and tools to deploy, manage, test, and monitor ML in real-world production settings. There are some initial tools aimed at model operations and testing—mainly for deploying and <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441\">monitoring ML</a><a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/the-artificial-intelligence/9781492025894/9781492025894-video323441\"> models</a>—but it’s clear we are still in the early stages for solutions in these areas.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>There are three <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">common issues that diminish the value of ML models</a> once they’re in production. The first is <em>concept drift</em>: the accuracy of models in production degrades over time, because of changes in the real world, stemming from a growing disparity between the data they were trained on and the data they are used on. The second is <em>locality</em>: when deploying models to new geographic locations, user demographics, or business customers, it’s often not the case that pre-trained models work at the expected level of accuracy. Measuring online accuracy per customer / geography / demographic group is important both to monitor bias and to ensure accuracy for a growing customer base. The third is <em>data quality</em>: since ML models are more sensitive to the semantics of incoming data, changes in data distribution that are often missed by traditional data quality tools wreak havoc on models’ accuracy.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Beyond the need to monitor that your current deployed models operate as intended, another challenge is knowing that a newly proposed model actually delivers better performance in production. Some <a href=\"https://www.datatron.com/\">early systems</a> allow for the comparison of an “incumbent model” against “challenger models,” including having challengers in “dark launch” or “offline” mode (this means challenger models are evaluated on production traffic but haven’t been deployed to production). Other noteworthy items include:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>Tools for continuous integration and continuous testing of models. A model is not “correct” if it returns a valid value—it has to meet an accuracy bar. There needs to be a way to validate this against a given metric and validation set before deploying a model.</li>\\n\\t<li>Online measurement of the accuracy of each model (what’s the accuracy that users are experiencing “in the field”?). Related to this is the need to monitor bias, locality effects, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/managing-risk-in-machine-learning\">related risks</a>. For example, scores often need to be broken down by demographics (are men and women getting similar accuracy?) or locales (are German and Spanish users getting similar accuracy?).</li>\\n\\t<li>The ability to manage the quality of service for model inference to different customers, including rate limiting, request size limiting, metering, bot detection, and IP geo-fencing.</li>\\n\\t<li>Ability to scale (and auto-scale), secure, monitor, and troubleshoot live models. Scaling has two dimensions—the size of the traffic hitting the models and the number of models that need to be evaluated.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Model operations and testing is very much still a nascent field where systematic checklists are just beginning to be assembled. An overview from a <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf\">2017 paper from Google</a> lets us gauge how much tooling is still needed for model operations and testing. This paper came with a <em>28-item checklist</em> that detailed things that need to be accounted for in order to have a reliable, production-grade machine learning system:</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<ul>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Features and data</strong>: seven items that include checks for privacy controls, feature validation, exploring the necessity and cost of a feature, and other data-related tests.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Tests for model development</strong>: seven sanity checks, including checking whether a simpler model will suffice, model performance on critical data slices (e.g., region, age, recency, frequency, etc.), the impact of model staleness, and other important considerations.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Infrastructure tests</strong>: a suite of seven considerations, including the reproducibility of model training, the ease with which models can be rolled back, integration tests on end-to-end model pipelines, model tests via a <a href=\"https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/canary-canary-testing\">canary process</a>.</li>\\n\\t<li>\\n<strong>Monitoring</strong>: the authors list a series of seven items to ensure models are working as expected. This includes tests for <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/lessons-learned-turning-machine-learning-models-into-real-products-and-services\">model staleness</a>, performance metrics (training, inference, throughput), validating that training and serving code generate similar values, and other essential items.</li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<h2>New roles</h2>\\n\\n<p>Discussions around machine learning tend to revolve around the work of data scientists and model building experts. This is beginning to change now that many companies are entering the implementation phase for their ML initiatives. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/what-are-machine-learning-engineers\">Machine learning engineers</a>, data engineers, developers, and domain experts are critical to the success of ML projects. At the moment, few (if any) teams have checklists as extensive as the one detailed in the <a href=\"https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/aad9f93b86b7addfea4c419b9100c6cdd26cacea.pdf\">2017 paper from Google</a>. The task of building real-world production-grade ML models still requires stitching together tools and teams that cut across many functional areas. However, as tools for model governance and model operations and testing begin to get refined and become more widely available, it’s likely that specialists (an “ML ops team”) will be tasked to use such tools. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/deep-automation-in-machine-learning\">Automation</a> will also be an important component, as these tools will need to enable organizations to build, manage, and <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/we-need-to-build-machine-learning-tools-to-augment-machine-learning-engineers\">monitor many more machine learning models</a>.</p>\\n\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-6LDiA\"><img alt=\"Demand for tools for managing ML in the enterprise\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/Figure2-c9a455c660bff61358774ec606b9b739.png\"><figcaption><span class=\"label\">Figure 2. </span>Demand for tools for managing ML in the enterprise.

There has been a significant increase in our ability to build complex AI models for predictions, classifications, and various analytics tasks, and there’s an abundance of (fairly easy-to-use) tools that allow data scientists and analysts to provision complex models within days. As model building become easier, the problem of high-quality data becomes more evident than ever. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/ai-adoption-in-the-enterprise.csp\">A recent O’Reilly survey</a> found that those with <em>mature</em> AI practices (as measured by how long they’ve had models in production) cited “Lack of data or data quality issues” as the main bottleneck holding back further adoption of AI technologies.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<figure class=\"center\" id=\"id-31Vik\"><img alt=\"data bottleneck holding back further adoption of AI technologies\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/image1-b039cca370f108b6653f4e1bb5175d91.png\"></figure>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Even with advances in building robust models, the reality is that noisy data and incomplete data remain the biggest hurdles to effective end-to-end solutions. The problem is even more magnified in the case of structured enterprise data. These data sets are often siloed, incomplete, and extremely sparse. Moreover, the domain knowledge, which often is not encoded in the data (nor fully documented), is an integral part of this data (see <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2019/01/15/why-machine-learning-needs-semantics-not-just-statistics/#23cb6a9e77b5\">this</a> article from Forbes).

Data unification or integration refers to the set of activities that bring this data together into one unified data context. Schema matching and mapping, record linkage and deduplication, and various mastering activities are the types of tasks a data integration solution performs. Advances in ML offer a scalable and efficient way to replace legacy top-down, rule-based systems, which often result in massive costs and very low success in today’s big data settings. Bottom-up solutions with human-guided ML pipelines (such as Tamr, Paxata, or Informatica—<em>full disclosure: Ihab Ilyas is co-founder of Tamr</em>) show how to leverage the available rules and human expertise to train scalable integration models that work on thousands of sources and large volumes of data. We discussed some of the challenges and enablers in using ML for this class of problems in an earlier <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/three-enablers-for-machine-learning-in-data-unification-trust-legacy-and-scale\">post</a>.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The class of data unification problems has its own characteristics in terms of solution complexity: (1) the problem is often quadratic in the size of the input (since we need to compare everything to everything else), and (2) the main ML task is fairly understood and is mainly determining if two “things” are the same. These characteristics have a considerable impact on the design of the solution. For example, a complex sophisticated model for finding duplicates or matching schema is the least of our worries if we cannot even enumerate all possible pairs that need to be checked. Effective solutions for data unification problems tend to be a serious engineering effort to: (1) prune the space of possible candidates; (2) interact effectively with experts to provide training data and validate the machine decision; and (3) keep rich lineage and provenance to track decisions back for auditing, revising, or reusing for future use cases. Due to the nature of the ML task (mainly Boolean classification here), and the richness of structure, most successful models tend to be the good old “shallow” models, such as random forest, with the help of simple language models (to help with strings data). See this article on <a href=\"https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~ilyas/papers/StonebrakerIEEE2018.pdf\">data integration status</a> for details.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h3>Error detection, repairing and value imputation</h3>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Siloed or integrated data is often noisy, missing, and sometimes even has contradicting facts. <em>Data cleaning</em> is the class of data quality efforts that focuses on spotting and (hopefully) repairing such errors. Like data integration, data cleaning exercises often have been carried out with intensive labor work, or ad-hoc rule-based point solutions. However, this class has different complexities and characteristics that affect the design of the solution: the core ML task is often far more complex than a matching task, and requires building models that understand “how data was generated” and “how errors were introduced” to be able to reverse that process to spot and repair errors.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>While data cleaning has long been a research topic in academia, it often has been looked at as a theoretical logic problem. This probably explains why none of the solutions have been adopted in industry. The good news is that researchers from academia recently managed to leverage that large body of work and combine it with the power of scalable statistical inference for data cleaning. The open source <a href=\"http://www.holoclean.io\">HoloClean</a> probabilistic cleaning framework is currently the <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03402\">state-of-the-art system</a> for ML-based automatic error detection and repair. HoloClean adopts the well-known <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noisy_channel_model\">“noisy channel”</a> model to explain how data was generated and how it was “polluted.” It then leverages all known domain knowledge (such as available rules), statistical information in the data, and available trusted sources to build complex data generation and error models. The models are then used to spot errors and suggest the “most probable” values to replace.</p> \\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Paying attention to scale is a requirement cleaning and integration have in common: building such complex models involves “featurizing” the whole data set via a series of operations—for example, to compute violations of rules, count co-occurrences, or build language models. Hence, an ML cleaning solution would need to be innovative on how to avoid the complexity of these operations. HoloClean, for example uses techniques to prune the domain of database cell and apply judicious relaxations to the underlying model to achieve the required scalability. Older research tools struggled with how to handle the various types of errors, and how to combine the heterogeneous quality input (e.g., business and quality rules, policies, statistical signals in the data, etc.). The HoloClean framework advances the state of the art in two fundamental ways: (1) combining the logical rules and the statistical distribution of the data into one coherent probabilistic model; and (2) scaling the learning and inference process via a series of system and model optimizations, which allowed it to be deployed in census organizations and large commercial enterprises.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Data programming</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Increasing the quality of the available data via either unification or cleaning, or both, is definitely an important and a promising way forward to leverage enterprise data assets. However, the quest for <em>more</em> data is not over, for two main reasons:</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ol>\\r\\n\\t<li>ML models for cleaning and unification often need training data and examples of possible errors or matching records. Depending completely on human labeling for these examples is simply a non-starter; as ML models get more complex and the underlying data sources get larger, the need for more data increases, the scale of which cannot be achieved by human experts.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Even if we boosted the quality of the available data via unification and cleaning, it still might not be enough to power the even more complex analytics and predictions models (often built as a deep learning model).</li>\\r\\n</ol>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>An important paradigm for solving both these problems is the concept of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.07723\">data programming</a>. In a nutshell, data programming techniques provide ways to “manufacture” data that we can feed to various learning and predictions tasks (even for ML data quality solutions). In practical terms, “data programming” unifies a class of techniques used for the programmatic creation of training data sets. In this category of tools, frameworks like <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/\">Snorkel</a> show how to allow developers and data scientists to focus on writing labeling functions to programmatically label data, and then model the noise in the labels to effectively train high-quality models. While using data programming to train high-quality analytics models might be clear, we find it interesting how it is used internally in ML models for the data unification and cleaning we mentioned earlier in this post. For example, tools like <a href=\"http://www.tamr.com\">Tamr</a> leverage legacy rules written by customers to generate a large amount of (programmatically) labeled data to power its matching ML pipeline. In a <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.02285\">recent paper,</a> the HoloClean project showed how to use “data augmentation” to generate many examples of possible errors (from a small seed) to power its automatic error detection model.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<h2>Market validation</h2>\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>The landscape of solutions we presented here for the quest for high-quality data have already been well validated in the market today.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n<ul>\\r\\n\\t<li>ML solutions for data unification such as Tamr and Informatica have been deployed at a large number of Fortune-1000 enterprises.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>Automatic data cleaning solutions such as HoloClean already have been deployed by multiple financial services and the census bureaus of various countries.</li>\\r\\n\\t<li>As the growing <a href=\"https://hazyresearch.github.io/snorkel/\">list of Snorkel users</a> suggests, data programming solutions are beginning to change the way data scientists provision ML models.</li>\\r\\n</ul>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>As we get more mature in understanding the differences between the various problems of integration, cleaning, and automatic data generation, we will see real improvement in handling the valuable data assets in the enterprise.</p>\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n<p>Machine learning applications rely on three main components: models, data, and compute.
