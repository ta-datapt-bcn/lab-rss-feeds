Those suspicions were confirmed when we quickly received more than 1,900 responses to our mid-November survey request. The responses show a surfeit of concerns around data quality and some uncertainty about how best to address those concerns.</p>\\n<p>Key survey results:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>The C-suite is engaged with data quality.</strong> CxOs, vice presidents, and directors account for 20% of all survey respondents. Data scientists and analysts, data engineers, and the people who manage them comprise 40% of the audience; developers and their managers, about 22%.</li>\\n<li><strong>Data quality might get worse before it gets better. </strong>Comparatively few organizations have created dedicated data quality teams. Just 20% of organizations publish data provenance and data lineage. Most of those who don’t say they have no plans to start.</li>\\n<li><strong>Adopting AI can help data quality.</strong> Almost half (48%) of respondents say they use data analysis, machine learning, or AI tools to address data quality issues. Those respondents are more likely to surface and address latent data quality problems. Can AI be a catalyst for improved data quality?</li>\\n<li><strong>Organizations are dealing with multiple, simultaneous data quality issues</strong>. They have too many different data sources and too much inconsistent data. They don’t have the resources they need to clean up data quality problems. And that’s just the beginning.</li>\\n<li><strong>The building blocks of data governance are often lacking within organizations</strong>. These include the basics, such as metadata creation and management, data provenance, data lineage, and other essentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The top-line good news is that people at all levels of the enterprise seem to be alert to the importance of data quality. The top-line bad news is that organizations aren’t doing enough to address their data quality issues. They’re making do with inadequate—or non-existent—controls, tools, and practices. They’re still struggling with the basics: tagging and labeling data, creating (and managing) metadata, managing unstructured data, etc.</p>\\n<h2>Respondent demographics</h2>\\n<h3>Analysts and engineers predominate</h3>\\n<p>Nearly one-quarter of respondents work as data scientists or analysts (see Figure 1). An additional 7% are data engineers. On top of this, close to 8% manage data scientists or engineers. That means that about 40% of the sample consists of front-line practitioners. This is hardly surprising. Analysts and data engineers are, arguably, the people who work most closely with data.</p>\\n<p>In practice, however, almost every data scientist and analyst also doubles as a data engineer: she spends a significant proportion of her time locating, preparing, and cleaning up data for use in analysis. In this way, data scientists and data analysts arguably have a personal stake in data quality. They’re often the first to surface data quality problems; in organizations that do not have dedicated data quality teams (or analogous resources, such as data quality centers of excellence), analysts play a leading role in cleaning up and correcting data quality issues, too.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-1.png\" alt=\"Roles of survey respondents\"><figcaption>Figure 1. Roles of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>A switched-on C-suite?</h3>\\n<p>Respondents who work in upper management—i.e., as directors, vice presidents, or CxOs—constitute a combined one-fifth of the sample. This is surprising. These results suggest that data quality has achieved salience of some kind in the minds of upper-level management. But what kind of salience? That’s a tricky question.</p>\\n<p>Role-wise, the survey sample is dominated by (1) practitioners who work with data and/or code and (2) the people who directly manage them—most of whom, notionally, also have backgrounds in data and/or code. This last point is important. A person who manages a data science or data engineering team—or, for that matter, a DevOps or AIOps practice—functions for all intents and purposes as an interface between her team(s) and the person (also typically a manager) to whom she directly reports. She’s “management,” but she’s still at the front line. And she likely also groks the practical, logistical, and political issues that (in their intersectionality) combine to make data quality such a thorny problem.</p>\\n<p>Executives bring a different, <em>transcendent</em>, perspective to bear in assessing data quality, particularly with respect to its impact on business operations and strategy. Executives see the big picture, not only vis-à-vis operations and strategy, but also with respect to problems—and, especially, <em>complaints</em>—in the units that report to them. Executive buy-in and support is usually seen as one of the pillars of any successful data quality program because data quality is more a people-and-process-laden problem than a technological one. It isn’t just that different groups have differing standards, expectations, or priorities when it comes to data quality; it’s that different groups will <em>go to war</em> over these standards, expectations, and priorities. Data quality solutions almost always boil down to two big issues: politics and cost. Some group(s) are going to have to change the way they do things; the money to pay for data quality improvements must come out of this or that group’s budget.</p>\\n<p>Executive interest can be a useful—if not infallible—proxy for an organization’s posture with respect to data quality. Historically, the executive who understood the importance of data quality was an exception, with few enlightened CxOs spearheading data quality initiatives or helping kick-start a data quality center of excellence. Whether due to organizations becoming more data driven, or the increased attention paid to the effects of data quality on AI efforts, increased C-suite buy-in is a positive development.</p>\\n<h2>Organizational demographics</h2>\\n<p>About half of survey respondents are based in North America. Slightly more than a quarter are in Europe—inclusive of the United Kingdom—while about one-sixth are in Asia. Combined, respondents in South America and the Middle East account for just under 10% of the survey sample.</p>\\n<p>Drilling down deeper, almost two-fifths of the survey audience works in tech-laden verticals such as software, consulting/professional services, telcos, and computers/hardware (Figure 2). This <em>could</em> impart a slight tech bias to the results. On the other hand, between 5% and 10% of respondents work in each of a broad swath of other verticals, including: healthcare, government, higher education, and retail/e-commerce. (“Other,” the second largest category, with about 15% of respondents, encompasses more than a dozen other verticals.) So concern about tech-industry bias could be offset by the fact that virtually all industries are, in effect, tech-dependent.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-2.png\" alt=\"Industries of survey respondents\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 2. Industries of survey respondents.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Size-wise, there’s a good mix in the survey base: nearly half of respondents work in organizations with 1,000 employees or more; slightly more than half, at organizations with 1,000 employees or less.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-3.png\" alt=\"Organization size\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 3. Organization size.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h2>Data quality issues and affects</h2>\\n<p>We asked respondents to select from among a list of common data quality problems. Respondents were encouraged to select all issues that apply to them (Figure 4).</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-4-e1580931638152-1048x587.png\" alt=\"Figure 4: Data quality survey 20. Primary data quality issues faced by respondents’ organizations.\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 4. Primary data quality issues faced by respondents’ organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Too many data sources, too little consistency</h3>\\n<p>By a wide margin, respondents rate the sheer preponderance of data sources as the single most common data quality issue. More than 60% of respondents selected “Too many data sources and inconsistent data,” followed by “Disorganized data stores and lack of metadata,” which was selected by just under 50% of respondents (Figure 4).</p>\\n<p>There’s something else to think about, too. This was a select-all-that-apply-type question, which means that you’d expect to see some inflation for the very first option on the list, i.e., “Poorly labeled data,” which was selected by just under 44% of respondents. Choosing the first item in a select-all-that-apply list is a human behavior statisticians have learned to expect and (if necessary) to control for.</p>\\n<p>But “Poorly labeled data” was actually the fifth most common problem, trailing not only the issues above, but “Poor data quality controls at data entry” (selected by close to 47%) and “Too few resources available to address data quality issues” (selected by less than 44%), as well. On the other hand, the combination of “Poorly labeled data” and “Unlabeled data” tallies close to 70%.</p>\\n<p>There’s good and bad in this. First, the bad: reducing the number of data sources is hard.</p>\\n<p>IT fought the equivalent of a rear-guard action against this very problem through most of the 1990s and 2000s. Data management practitioners even coined a term—“<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spreadmart\">spreadmart</a> hell”—to describe what happens when several different individuals or groups maintain spreadsheets of the same data set. The self-service use case helped exacerbate this problem: the first generation of self-service data analysis tools eschewed features (such as metadata creation and management, provenance/lineage tracking, and data synchronization) that are essential for data quality and good data governance.</p>\\n<p>In other words, the sheer preponderance of data sources isn’t a bug: it’s a feature. If history is any indication, it’s a problem that isn’t going to go away: multiple, redundant, sometimes inconsistent copies of useful data sets will always be with us.</p>\\n<p>On the good side, technological progress—e.g., front-end tools that generate metadata and capture provenance and lineage; data cataloging software that manages provenance and lineage—could tamp down on this. So, too, could cultural transformation: e.g., a top-down push to educate people about data quality, data governance, and general data literacy.</p>\\n<h3>Organizations are flunking Data Governance 101</h3>\\n<p>Some common data quality issues point to larger, institutional problems. “Disorganized data stores and lack of metadata” is fundamentally a governance issue. But just 20% of survey respondents say their organizations publish information about data provenance or data lineage, which—along with robust metadata—are essential tools for diagnosing and resolving data quality issues. If the management of data provenance/lineage is taken as a proxy for good governance, few organizations are making the cut. Nor is it surprising that so many respondents also cite unlabeled/poorly labeled data as a problem. You can’t fake good governance.</p>\\n<p>Still another hard problem is that of “Poor data quality controls at data entry.” Anyone who has worked with data knows that data entry issues are persistent and endemic, if not intractable.</p>\\n<p>Some other common data quality issues (Figure 4)—e.g., poor data quality from third-party sources (cited by about 36% of respondents), missing data (about 37%), and unstructured data (more than 40%)—are less insidious, but no less frustrating. Practitioners may have little or no control over providers of third-party data. Missing data will always be with us—as will an institutional reluctance to make it whole. As for a lack of resources (cited by more than 40% of respondents), there’s at least some reason for hope: machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) could provide a bit of a boost. Data engineering and data analysis tools use ML to simplify and substantively automate some of the tasks involved in discovering, profiling, and indexing data.</p>\\n<p>Not surprisingly, almost half (48%) of respondents say they use data analysis, machine learning, or AI tools to address data quality issues. A deeper dive (Figure 5) provides an interesting take: organizations that have dedicated data quality teams use analytic and AI tools at a higher rate, 59% compared to the 42% of respondents from organizations with no dedicated data quality team. Having a team focused on data quality can provide the space and motivation to invest in trying and learning tools that make the team more productive. Few data analysts or data engineers have the time or capacity to make that commitment, instead relying on ad hoc methods to address the data quality issues they face.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-9-e1580932248483-1048x482.png\" alt=\"Figure 5: Data quality survey \\'20. Effect of dedicated data quality team on using AI tools.\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 5. Effect of dedicated data quality team on using AI tools.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>That being said, data quality, like data governance, is fundamentally a socio-technical problem. ML and AI can help to an extent, but it’s incumbent on the organization itself to make the necessary people and process changes. After all, people and processes are almost always implicated in both the creation and the <em>perpetuation </em>of data quality issues. Ultimately, diagnosing and resolving data quality problems requires a genuine commitment to governance.</p>\\n<p>Data conditioning is expensive and resource intensive (and decidedly not sexy), one of the reasons we don’t see more formal support for data quality amongst respondents. To increase the focus on resolving data issues requires carefully scrutinizing the ROI of data conditioning efforts to focus on the most worthwhile, productive, and effective efforts.</p>\\n<h3>Biases, damned biases, and missing data</h3>\\n<p>Just under 20% of respondents cited “Biased data” as a primary data quality issue (Figure 4). We often talk about the need to address bias and fairness in data. But here the evidence suggests that respondents see bias as less problematic than other common data quality issues. Do they know something we don’t? Or are respondents themselves biased—in this case, by what they can’t imagine? This result underscores the importance of acknowledging that data contains biases; that we should assume (not rule out) the existence of unknown biases; and that we should promote the development of formal diversity (cognitive, cultural, socio-economic, physical, background, etc.) and processes to detect, acknowledge, and address those biases.</p>\\n<p>Missing data plays into this, too. It isn’t just that we lack the data we believe we need for the work we want to do. Sometimes we don’t know or can’t imagine what data we need. A textbook example of this comes via Abraham Wald’s analysis of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@penguinpress/an-excerpt-from-how-not-to-be-wrong-by-jordan-ellenberg-664e708cfc3d\">how to improve the placement of armor on World War II-era bombers</a>: Wald wanted to study the bombers that had been shot down, which was practically impossible. However, he was able to make inferences about the effect of what is now called<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias\"> survivor bias</a> by factoring in what was missing, i.e., that the planes that returned from successful missions had an inverse pattern of damage relative to those that had been shot down. His insight was a corrective to the collective bias of the Army’s Statistical Research Group (SRG). The SRG could not imagine that it was missing data.</p>\\n<h3>No data quality issue is an island entire of itself</h3>\\n<p>Organizations aren’t dealing with only one data quality issue. It’s more complicated than that—with more than half of respondents reporting at least four data quality issues.</p>\\n<p>Figure 6, below, combines two things. The dark green portion of each horizontal bar shows the share of survey respondents who reported that specific number of discrete data quality issues at their organizations&nbsp; (i.e., 3 issues or 4 issues, etc.). The light gray/green portion of each bar shows the aggregate share of respondents who reported <em>at least</em> that number of data quality issues (i.e., at least 2 issues, at least 3 issues, etc.).</p>\\n<p>A few highlights to help navigate this complex chart:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Respondents most often report either three or four data quality issues. The dark green portion of the horizontal bars show about 16% of respondents for each of these results.</li>\\n<li>Looking at the aggregates of the “at least 4” and “at least 3” items, we see the light gray/green section of the chart shows 56% of respondents reporting at least four data quality issues and 71% reporting at least three data quality issues.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>That organizations face myriad data quality issues is not a surprise. What is surprising is that organizations don’t more often take a structured or formal approach to addressing their own unique, gnarly combination of data quality challenges.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-5.png\" alt=\"Number of data quality issues reported\"><figcaption>Figure 6. Number of data quality issues reported.</figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Lineage and provenance continue to lag</h3>\\n<p>A significant majority of respondents—almost 80%—say their organizations do not publish information about data provenance or data lineage.</p>\\n<p>If this is surprising, it shouldn’t be. Lineage and provenance are inextricably bound with data governance, which overlaps significantly with data quality. As we saw, most organizations are failing Data Governance 101. Data scientists, data engineers, software developers, and other technologists use provenance data to verify the output of a workflow or data processing pipeline—or, as often as not, to diagnose problems. Provenance notes where the data in a data set came from; which transformations, if any, have been applied to it; and other technical minutiae.</p>\\n<p>With respect to business intelligence and analytics, data lineage provides a mechanism business people, analysts, and auditors can use to trust and verify data. If an auditor has questions about the values in a report or the contents of a data set, they can use the data lineage record to retrace its history. In this way, provenance and lineage give us confidence that the content of a data set is both explicable and reproducible.</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-6.png\" alt=\"Data provenance and lineage tools\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 7. Data provenance and lineage tools.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Of the 19% of survey respondents whose organizations <em>do</em> manage lineage and provenance, slightly less than 30% say they use a version control system—<em>a la</em> Git—to do this (Figure 7). Another one-fifth use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface\">notebook</a> environment (such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Jupyter\">Jupyter</a>). The remaining 50% (i.e., of respondents whose organizations do publish lineage and provenance) use a smattering of open source and commercial libraries and tools, most of which are mechanisms for managing provenance, not lineage.</p>\\n<p>If provenance and lineage are so important, why do few organizations publish information about them?</p>\\n<p>Because lineage, especially, is hard. It imposes access and use constraints that make it more difficult for business people to do what they want with data—especially as regards sharing and/or changing it. First-generation self-service analytic tools made it easier—and, in some cases, <em>possible</em>—for people to share and experiment with data. But the ease-of-use and agency that these tools promoted came at a price: first-gen self-service tools eschewed data lineage, metadata management, and other, similar mechanisms.</p>\\n<p>A best practice for capturing data lineage is to incorporate mechanisms for generating and managing metadata—including lineage metadata—into front- and back-end tools. ETL tools are a textbook example of this: almost all ETL tools generate <a href=\"https://unifisoftware.com/blog/2019/04/in-the-beginninglineage-part-iii/\">granular (“technical”) lineage data</a>. Until recently, however, most self-service tools lacked rich metadata management features or capabilities.</p>\\n<p>This might explain why nearly two-thirds of respondents whose organizations do <em>not</em> publish provenance and lineage answered “No” to the follow-up question: “Does your organization <em>plan</em> on implementing tools or processes to publish data provenance and lineage?” For the vast majority of organizations, provenance and lineage is a dream deferred (Figure 8).</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-7.png\" alt=\"Plans for publishing data provenance and lineage\">&nbsp;<figcaption>Figure 8. Plans for publishing data provenance and lineage.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>The good news is that the pendulum could be swinging in the direction of governance.</p>\\n<p>Slightly more than one-fifth selected “Within the next year” in response to this question, while about one-sixth answered “Beyond next year.” Most popular open source programming and analytic environments (Jupyter Notebooks, the R environment, even Linux itself) support data provenance via built-in or third-party projects and libraries. Commercial data analysis tools now offer increasingly robust metadata management features. In the same way, data catalog vendors, too, are making metadata management—with an emphasis on data lineage—a priority. Meanwhile, the Linux Foundation sponsors <a href=\"https://www.odpi.org/projects/egeria\">Egeria</a>, an open source standard for metadata management and exchange.</p>\\n<h3>Data quality is not a team effort</h3>\\n<p>Based on feedback from respondents, comparatively few organizations have created dedicated data quality teams (Figure 9). Most (70%) answered “No” to the question “Does your organization have a dedicated data quality team?”</p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/01/dq20-8.png\" alt=\"Presence of dedicated data quality teams in organizations\"><figcaption>Figure 9. Presence of dedicated data quality teams in organizations.</figcaption></figure>\\n<p>Few respondents who answered “Yes” to this question actually work on their organization’s dedicated data quality team. Nearly two-thirds (62%) answered “No” to the follow-up question “Do you work on the dedicated data quality team?”; just 38% answered “Yes.” Only respondents who answered “Yes” to the question “Does your organization have a dedicated data quality team?” were permitted to answer the follow-up. All told, 12% of all survey respondents work on a dedicated data quality team.</p>\\n<h3>Real-time data on the rise</h3>\\n<p>Relatedly, we asked respondents who work in organizations that do have dedicated data quality teams if these teams also work with real-time data.</p>\\n<p>Almost two-thirds (about 61%) answered “Yes.” We know from other research that organizations are prioritizing efforts to do more with real-time data. In <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/topics-to-watch-at-the-strata-data-conference-in-new-york-2019/\">our recent analysis of Strata Conference speakers’ proposals</a>, for example, terms that correlate with real-time use cases were entrenched in the first tier of proposal topics. “Stream” was the No. 4 overall term; “Apache Kafka,” a stream-processing platform, was No. 17; and “real-time” itself sat at No. 44.</p>\\n<p>“Streaming” isn’t identical with “real-time,” of course. But there <em>is</em> evidence for overlap between <a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=kafka+%22real-time+data%22&amp;oq=kafka+%22real-time+data%22&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.3886j0j4&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\">the use of stream-processing technologies and so-called “real-time” use cases</a>. Similarly, the rise of next-gen architectural regimes (such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices\">microservices architecture</a>) is also driving demand for real-time data: A microservices architecture consists of hundreds, thousands, or tens of thousands of services, each of which generates logging and diagnostic data in real-time. Architects and software engineers are building <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observability\">observability</a>—basically, monitoring on steroids—into these next-gen apps to make it easier to diagnose and fix problems. This is a compound real-time data and real-time analytics problem.</p>\\n<h3>The world is not a monolith</h3>\\n<p>For the most part, organizations in North America seem to be dealing with the same problems as their counterparts in other regions. Industry representation, job roles, employment experience, and other indicia were surprisingly consistent across all regions—although there were a few intriguing variances. For example, the proportion of “directors/vice presidents” was about one-third higher for North American respondents than for the rest of the world, while the North American proportion of consulting/professional services respondents was close to half the tally for the rest of the globe.</p>\\n<p>Our analysis surfaced at least one other intriguing geographical variance. As noted in Figure 9, we asked each participant if their organization maintains a dedicated data quality team. While North America and the rest of the world had about the same share of respondents with dedicated data quality teams, our North American respondents were less likely to <em>work</em> on that data quality team.</p>\\n<h2>Takeaways</h2>\\n<p>A review of the survey results yields a few takeaways organizations can use to realistically address how they can condition their data to improve the efficacy of their analytics and models.</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>Most organizations should take formal steps to condition and improve their data, such as creating dedicated data quality teams. But conditioning data is an on-going process, not a one-and-done panacea. This is why C-suite buy-in—as difficult as it is to obtain—is a prerequisite for sustained data quality remediation. Promoting C-suite understanding and commitment may require education as many execs have little or no experience working with data or analytics.</li>\\n<li>Conditioning is neither easy nor cheap. Committing to formal processes and dedicated teams helps set expectations about the difficult work of remediating data issues. High costs should compel organizations to take an ROI-based approach to how and where to deploy their data conditioning resources. This includes deciding what is not worth addressing.</li>\\n<li>Organizations that pursue AI initiatives usually discover that they have data quality issues hiding in plain sight. The problem (and partial solution) is that they need quality data to power their AI projects. Think of AI as the carrot, and of poor data as the proverbial stick. The upshot is that investment in AI can become a catalyst for data quality remediation.</li>\\n<li>AI is an answer, but not the only one. AI-enriched tools can improve productivity and simplify much of the work involved in improving data efficacy. But our survey results suggest that a dedicated data quality team also helps to foster the use of AI-enriched tools. What’s more, a dedicated team is motivated to invest in learning to use these tools well; conversely, few analysts and data engineers have the time or capacity to fully master these tools.</li>\\n<li>Data governance is all well and good, but organizations need to start with more basic stuff: data dictionaries to help explain data; tracking provenance, lineage, recency; and other essentials.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/i98UOAM44uo\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

They are working on automated tools for controlling abuse. As is every other social media company.</p>\\n<p>Facebook has launched a tool for clearing your history of off-facebook activity. Unfortunately, it <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/615111/facebook-has-finally-launched-its-clear-history-button-but-it-doesnt-delete-anything/\">doesn’t actually delete anything</a>. Frankly, I don’t understand why Facebook expects to be believed. Maybe they don’t, and they’ve just ceased to care.</p>\\n<p>Google has acquired AppSheet, a platform that allows people to <a href=\"https://venturebeat.com/2020/01/14/google-acquires-no-code-app-development-platform-appsheet/\">develop enterprise applications without writing code</a>. Software development without actual programming is a theme that continues to build.</p>\\n<p>The <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/this-week-in-programming-forget-microservices-monoliths-are-the-way-forward/\">New Stack newsletter</a> essentially says that monoliths are the new black. I’ve seen this theme coming from many directions, including <a href=\"https://changelog.com/posts/monoliths-are-the-future\">Kelsey Hightower</a> and David Heinemeier Hansson.</p>\\n<h2>Trends from CES</h2>\\n<p>Arduino has long been the darling of the maker crowd, but it’s also gotten a substantial niche in industrial controls. At CES, they <a href=\"https://blog.arduino.cc/2020/01/07/arduino-goes-pro-at-ces-2020/\">announced</a> a version of the Arduino (called Portenta) that’s hardened for industrial applications, plus native Python and JavaScript.</p>\\n<p>More news from CES: <a href=\"https://techxplore.com/news/2020-01-ces-gadget-surveillance-inand-big.html\">self-imposed surveillance</a> is in. Extra points if you give your data to the police, along with any hacker who attacks your badly secured devices. This would be funny if it weren’t so unfunny.</p>\\n<p>Even more from CES: a <a href=\"https://gizmodo.com/you-could-replace-all-your-homes-wifi-hardware-with-thi-1840777128\">5G/Wi-Fi 6 hot spot/router</a> from NetGear. As I said a while ago, I think <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/a-5g-future/\">the last mile</a> is the real killer app for 5G. It’s small enough to fit in your pocket, so you can take it to hotels. Unfortunately, the assumption appears to be that 5G will have cell phone-like data limitations. What do 15 GB download limits mean on networks with gigabit bandwidths—or, more to the point, when consumers access streaming services that go from 4K video to 8K and beyond?</p>\\n<h2>Changing fashion trends</h2>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.inc.com/jason-aten/apple-is-moving-past-iphone-heres-why-thats-inevitable.html\">Post-iPhone Apple</a>: Inc. is more polite than me, but they’re basically saying the same thing—Apple is no longer a computer company; it’s a maker of high-tech fashion accessories. I suppose that means their real competition is Versace, not Google or Microsoft. And I wonder what “the rest of us” will do.</p>\\n<h2>Trends from China</h2>\\n<p>The Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) says it&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/2019-beginning-end-open-internet-era\">the beginning of the end</a> for the open internet: I couldn’t say it better. Authoritarian governments—and this will no doubt include the United States, but for the time being it’s China, Russia, and Iran—are moving to cut their networks off from the rest of the world. There will no longer be a global internet. Although we’ve already seen that exceptions can be made for the rich and powerful. (As was always the case with censorship.)</p>\\n<p>China is going all out on blockchain, but it’s not a blockchain that would be familiar to us: it’s centralized (of course). <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/f/615022/baidus-xuperchain-launch-is-just-the-beginning-of-chinas-blockchain-rush/\">Baidu</a> is launching their government-friendly Xuperchain; it’s now in public beta.</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/chubaofs-the-cloud-native-computing-foundations-speedy-new-distributed-file-system/\">ChubaoFS</a> is a new distributed filesystem that’s being pushed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. Somewhat ironically, this filesystem was contributed from China. At any rate, it bears watching; moving the entire filesystem to the cloud is an obvious next step for cloud computing.</p>\\n<h2>Trending ahead</h2>\\n<p>I didn’t write a set of predictions for 2020, let alone the whole decade of the 2020s. <a href=\"https://avc.com/2020/01/what-will-happen-in-the-2020s/\">Fred Wilson did</a>. There’s not much to disagree with, especially with respect to China: China will become the dominant superpower, while the US will stagnate in self-imposed isolationism, lacking the ability to import the talent it needs to make technological progress.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/Kq-5xqzcMx8\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>One of the biggest challenges operations groups will face over the coming year will be learning how to support AI- and ML-based applications. On one hand, ops groups are in a good position to do this; they&#8217;re already heavily invested in testing, monitoring, version control, reproducibility, and automation. On the other hand, they will have to learn a lot about how AI applications work and what&#8217;s needed to support them. There&#8217;s a lot more to AI Operations than Kubernetes and Docker. The operations community has the right language, and that&#8217;s a great start; I do <em>not</em> mean that in a dismissive sense. But on inspection, AI stretches the meanings of those terms in important but unfamiliar directions.</p>\\n<p>Three things need to be understood about AI.</p>\\n<p>First, the behavior of an AI application depends on a <em>model</em>, which is built from source code and <em>training data</em>. A model isn’t source code, and it isn’t data; it’s an artifact built from the two. Source code is relatively less important compared to typical applications; the training data is what determines how the model behaves, and the training process is all about tweaking parameters in the application so that it delivers correct results most of the time.</p>\\n<p>This means that, to have a history of how an application was developed, you have to look at more than the source code. You need a repository for models and for the training data. There are many tools for managing source code, from git back to the venerable SCCS, but we&#8217;re only starting to build tools for <a href=\"https://dvc.org/\">data versioning</a>. And that&#8217;s essential: if you need to understand how your model behaves, and you don&#8217;t have the training data, you&#8217;re sunk. The same is true for the models themselves; if you don&#8217;t have the artifacts you produced, you won&#8217;t be able to make statements about how they performed. Given source code and the training data, you could re-produce a model, but it almost certainly wouldn&#8217;t be the same because of randomization in the training process.</p>\\n<p>Second, the behavior of AI systems changes over time. Unlike a web application, they aren&#8217;t strictly dependent on the source. Models almost certainly react to incoming data; that&#8217;s their point. They may be retrained automatically. They almost certainly grow stale over time: users change the way they behave (often, the model is responsible for that change) and grow outdated.</p>\\n<p>This changes what we mean by &#8220;monitoring.&#8221; AI applications need to be monitored for staleness—whatever that might mean for your particular application. They also need to be monitored for fairness and bias, which can certainly creep in after deployment. And these results are inherently statistical. You need to collect a large number of data points to tell that a model has grown stale. It&#8217;s not like pinging a server to see if it&#8217;s down; it&#8217;s more like analyzing long-term trends in response time. We have the tools for that analysis; we just need to learn how to re-deploy them around issues like fairness.</p>\\n<p>We should also ask what &#8220;observability&#8221; means in a context where even &#8220;explainability&#8221; is always an issue. Is it important to observe what happens on each layer of a neural network? I don&#8217;t know, but that&#8217;s a question that certainly needs answering. Charity Majors&#8217; emphasis on <a href=\"https://thenewstack.io/observability-a-3-year-retrospective/\">cardinality</a> and inferring the internal states of a system from its outputs is certainly the right direction in which to be looking, but in AI systems, the number of internal states grows by many, many orders of magnitude.</p>\\n<p>Last, and maybe most important: AI applications are, above all, probabilistic. Given the same inputs, they don&#8217;t necessarily return the same results each time. This has important implications for testing. We can do unit testing, integration testing, and acceptance testing—but we have to acknowledge that AI is not a world in which testing whether 2 == 1+1 counts for much. And conversely, if you need software with that kind of accuracy (for example, a billing application), you shouldn&#8217;t be using AI. In the last two decades, a tremendous amount of work has been done on testing and building test suites. Now, it looks like that&#8217;s just a start. How do we test software whose behavior is fundamentally probabilistic? We will need to learn.</p>\\n<p>That’s the basics. There are other issues lurking. Collaboration between AI developers and operations teams will lead to growing pains on both sides, especially since many data scientists and AI researchers have had limited exposure to, or knowledge of, software engineering. The creation and management of data pipelines isn’t something that operations groups are responsible for–though, despite the proliferation of new titles like “data engineer” and “data ops,” in the future I suspect these jobs will be subsumed into “operations.”</p>\\n<p>It’s going to be an interesting few years as operations assimilates AI. The operations community is asking the right questions; we&#8217;ll learn the right answers.</p>\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Upcoming events</h2>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/conferences\">O’Reilly conferences</a> combine expert insights from industry leaders with hands-on guidance about today’s most important technology topics.</p>\\n<p>We hope you’ll join us at our upcoming events:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-ny\">O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference</a>, New York, February 23-26</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata-data-ai/stai-ca\">O’Reilly Strata Data &amp; AI Conference</a>, San Jose, March 15-18</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://oreilly.formulated.by/scme-phoenix-2020/\">Smart Cities &amp; Mobility Ecosystems Conference</a>, Phoenix, April 15-16</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/MHgcUeMfql0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>Roger Magoulas recently sat down with Edward Jezierski, reinforcement learning AI principal program manager at Microsoft, to talk about reinforcement learning (RL). They discuss why RL&#8217;s role in AI is so important, challenges of applying RL in a business environment, and how to approach ethical and responsible use questions.</p>\\n<p>Here are some highlights from their conversation:</p>\\n<p>Reinforcement learning is different than simply trying to detect something in an image or extract something from a data set, Jezierski explains— it&#8217;s about making decisions. &#8220;That entails a whole set of concepts that are about exploring the unknown,&#8221; he says. &#8220;You have the notion of exploring versus exploiting, which is do the tried and true versus trying something new. You bring in high-level concepts like the notion of curiosity—how much should you buy as you try new things? The notion of creativity—how crazy are the things you&#8217;re willing to try out? Reinforcement learning is a science that studies how these things come together in a learning system. (00:18)</p>\\n<p>The biggest challenge for businesses, Jezierski says, is correctly identifying and defining goals, and deciding how to measure success. For example, is it the click you&#8217;re after or something a bit deeper? This honest, clarifying conversation is key, he says. &#8220;This is why we&#8217;re focused first on the applied use of services because it can be very abstract otherwise. It&#8217;s like, &#8216;Oh, I&#8217;ve got to make decisions. I get rewards, and I&#8217;m going to explore—how do I look at my own business problem through that light?&#8217; A lot of people get tripped up in that. So we&#8217;ll try to say, &#8216;Look, we&#8217;re going to draw a smaller box. We&#8217;re going to say we want to define personalization using RL as &#8216;choose the right thing&#8217; for my menu in a context and tell us how well it went.&#8217; That&#8217;s not the universe of possibility, but 90% of people can frame a part of their problem that way. If we can design a small box where people in it can have guaranteed results and we can tell you whether you fit in the box or not, that&#8217;s a great way to get people started with RL.&#8221; (3:24)</p>\\n<p>Ethics and responsible use are essential facets of reinforcement learning, Jezierski notes. Guidelines in this area aren&#8217;t necessarily addressing bad actors, but are aiming to help those unaware of the consequences of what they&#8217;re doing become more aware and to help those who are aware of the consequences and have good intentions to have more backing. Asking the right questions, Jezierski explains, is the difficult part. &#8220;In reinforcement learning, you get very specific questions about ethics and personalization—like, where is it reasonable to apply reinforcement learning? Where is it consequential to explore or exploit? Should insurance policies be personalized in a webpage using reinforcement learning, and what are the attributes that should drive that? Or is an algorithm trying to find out better ways that are not goaled toward the purpose of insurance, which is a long-term financial pool of risk and social safety net. Is it even ethical to apply to that sort of scenario?&#8221; It&#8217;s important, Jezierski says, to make these types of conversations non-taboo in team environments, to empower anyone on the team to hit the brakes to address a potential issue. &#8220;If you have an ethical or responsible use concern, you can stop the process and it&#8217;s up to everybody else to justify why it should restart. It&#8217;s not up to you to justify why you stopped it. We take it very seriously because in the real world, these decisions will have consequences.&#8221; (9:40)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/NeKyY6FG_bY\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Yet, in comparison to the vast number of studies that examine intervention from the perspective of the individual bystander, we know surprisingly little about the situational intervention likelihood—that is, the probability that at least one bystander at the emergency event intervenes. [&#8230;] Using a unique cross-national video data set from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and South Africa (N = 219), we show that in nine of 10 public conflicts, at least one bystander, but typically several, will do something to help.</i> Although the Bystander Effect means an individual may feel less likely to help, there&#8217;s a 90% chance that *someone* will help.

I am less interested in making things for just a few precocious students, especially if teachers hate it.

So far, it&#8217;s been a painless shift in power, which as Eric Matthes, author of <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/python-crash-course/9781492071266/\"><em>Python Crash Course</em></a>, argues, should come as no surprise, since &#8220;Guido has carried himself, and his role in the community, with such poise for so long.&#8221; 2020 will also see <a href=\"https://pythonclock.org/\">the end of support for Python 2.7</a>, which will likely <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/think-app-updates-suck-try-upgrading-programming-language/\">cause its share of headaches</a> among holdouts. Meanwhile, Python continues to be <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/4d43bad2-2fcf-45f4-b8e4-a15f58442933/\">the language of choice for data science</a>.</p>\\n<p>For Matthes, one exciting aspect of Python has been &#8220;the variety of interesting and critical projects that have come out of a community where diversity has so intentionally been built for so long.&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.willingconsulting.com/\">Carol Willing</a>, a member of the Python Steering Council and a core developer of CPython, also celebrates these projects—like the Binder service, which promotes reproducible research by creating an executable environment from your Jupyter Notebooks—particularly as they expand beyond their initial aims. Binder, she notes, &#8220;was widely used last year for teaching workshops and tutorials at many Python conferences.&#8221; Willing also offered a shout-out to the CircuitPython and Mu projects, asking, &#8220;Who doesn&#8217;t love hardware, blinking LEDs, sensors, and using Mu, a user-friendly editor that is fantastic for adults and kids?&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>Java</h2>\\n<p>It&#8217;s mostly good news on the Java front. <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/search/?query=Ben%20Evans&amp;extended_publisher_data=true&amp;highlight=true&amp;include_assessments=false&amp;include_case_studies=true&amp;include_courses=true&amp;include_orioles=true&amp;include_playlists=true&amp;include_collections=true&amp;include_notebooks=true&amp;is_academic_institution_account=false&amp;source=user&amp;sort=relevance&amp;facet_json=true&amp;page=0\">Java Champion Ben Evans</a> explains, &#8220;Once again, rumours of Java&#8217;s demise have proved to be little more than wishful thinking on the part of the platform&#8217;s detractors.&#8221; But it hasn&#8217;t all been smooth sailing. As we noted last year, <a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/projects/jdk/11/\">the release of Java 11</a> in September 2018 brought a raft of new features, including many that give the release a significant, clear advantage for using containers. However, wide adoption of this latest release <a href=\"https://www.baeldung.com/java-in-2019\">hasn&#8217;t followed suit</a>, with more than 80% of developers still on Java 8, according to <a href=\"https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/devecosystem-2019/java/\">this JetBrains survey</a>. Evans wonders, &#8220;Does this mean that people aren&#8217;t running Java in containers as much as we&#8217;re told they are? Or do people just not know about the benefits of 11 in containers?&#8221;</p>\\n<p>Despite the slow rate of adoption, Java&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.infoq.com/news/2017/09/Java6Month/\">six-month release cadence</a> has been trucking along—Java 12 dropped in March 2019, with Java 13 following in September. And according to <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/moving-to-java/9780134857664\">Java Champion Trisha Gee</a>, it&#8217;s really starting to show its value:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Each release is quite small but predictable. And although they don&#8217;t all have exciting new language changes, you can see the language moving forward steadily. In addition, it enables this idea of preview features, which I think we saw working really well for switch expressions—developers got to try out the feature and give real feedback based on how it feels to work with, instead of feedback on abstract, conceptual ideas. In response, there was a small change to the syntax of switch expressions, which was possible due to it being a preview feature and not set in stone, in Java 13. Now this updated syntax is scheduled to be part of JDK 14 as a production-ready feature.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>2019 brought another surprise when Oracle moved Java SE to a subscription-based model. But as Marc Loy, coauthor of <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-java-5th/9781492056263/\"><em>Learning Java</em>, fifth edition</a> (now in early release), points out, &#8220;The Java community at large has approached this unfortunate change with <a href=\"https://medium.com/@javachampions/java-is-still-free-c02aef8c9e04\">increased enthusiasm for the OpenJDK</a>.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>As for the coming year, Evans suggests that 2020 will be about watching the 2019 trends play out:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>How close to a production version of <a href=\"https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/valhalla/Main\">Project Valhalla</a> will we be? Will the incremental strategy of delivering pattern matching and algebraic data types (<a href=\"https://openjdk.java.net/projects/amber/\">Project Amber</a>) pay off? Will <a href=\"https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/03/07/quarkus-next-generation-kubernetes-native-java-framework/\">Quarkus</a> bear out its promise and the faith of its early fans? Will 2020 be the year that Kotlin makes a significant beachhead beyond Android? These are exciting times—we&#8217;re in transition toward something new, and there&#8217;s a lot going on.</p></blockquote>\\n<h2>Kotlin</h2>\\n<p>Google announced in May 2019 that Kotlin is now <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/07/kotlin-is-now-googles-preferred-language-for-android-app-development/\">its preferred language for Android app developers</a>, boosting the language’s already strong adoption. Although many Android developers are still in the process of making the move to Kotlin, those who have already transitioned know the benefits it offers. Dawn and David Griffiths, authors of <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/head-first-kotlin/9781491996683/\"><em>Head First Kotlin</em></a>, share a few reasons behind Kotlin&#8217;s ascendance:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>For a language created by an IDE company, it&#8217;s no surprise that Kotlin has a healthy level of tooling support. The experimental DSL for code contracts gives developers the ability to provide guarantees about the ways that code behaves. Does your function have side effects? Is it guaranteed to return a non-null value? Code contracts allow you to make these promises, and the compiler can use them to loosen compile-time checks.</p>\\n<p>The barriers between different Kotlin platforms are now also breaking down. The &#8220;expect&#8221;/&#8221;actual&#8221; qualifiers allow developers to more easily write code that is compatible across Java/Native/JS environments. And serialization support now means that it&#8217;s even easier to convert JSON data into Kotlin objects, and vice versa.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Expect to see Kotlin continue its impressive growth—and not just in Android. <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/playlists/dd42ec64-a539-4bab-ad55-3473db4c7177/\">Hadi Hariri</a>, leader of the developer advocacy team at JetBrains, points to the success of Kotlin/Everywhere—a series of community-led events where you can learn the essentials and best practices of Kotlin in Android, Google Cloud Platform, and multiplatform development—as proof: &#8220;From May to November, we&#8217;ve managed to reach close to 30,000 people in 86 countries. <a href=\"https://kotlinconf.com/\">KotlinConf</a> sold out three years in a row with more than 1,700 attendees in 2019. This really shows, amongst other things, that interest and adoption of the language is growing.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>Go</h2>\\n<p>When Gophers think back on 2019, they&#8217;ll likely remember the saga of the try proposal. Go developer and writer Jon Bodner explains:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>One of the most common complaints about Go is that error handling is too verbose. So in early June, the Go core developers proposed adding <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/proposal/blob/master/design/32437-try-builtin.md\">a new built-in function called try</a>. <a href=\"https://github.com/golang/go/issues/32437\">A GitHub issue was opened</a> to discuss this new feature. Within a month, there were nearly 800 comments, most of them negative. The people who were against the new feature felt that this change made code too &#8220;magical&#8221; and obscured the logic flow. After reviewing the feedback, the Go team marked the proposal as closed and rejected on July 16.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>What&#8217;s notable about this process wasn&#8217;t the failure of the feature but rather, as Bodner describes it, &#8220;the way the process happened: a feature was proposed, the discussion was respectful, but many felt that the change was inconsistent with Go&#8217;s style. In the end, the people who steward the language decided to respect the majority opinion. That&#8217;s what developers mean when they talk about community.&#8221;</p>\\n<p>2020 should bring more clarity to Go&#8217;s Contracts specification, better known as <a href=\"https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/master/design/go2draft-contracts.md\">the Generics proposal</a>. According to Bodner, &#8220;It looks like Go is going to implement generics using an approach that is a bit different from other languages, but which fits nicely into the idioms of Go.&#8221; It will hopefully allow Go to keep its idiomatic style while adding a feature that developers have found useful in other languages.</p>\\n<h2>Rust</h2>\\n<p>We checked in with <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/search/?query=author%3A%22Jim%20Blandy%22&amp;extended_publisher_data=true&amp;highlight=true&amp;include_assessments=false&amp;include_case_studies=true&amp;include_courses=true&amp;include_orioles=true&amp;include_playlists=true&amp;include_collections=true&amp;include_notebooks=true&amp;is_academic_institution_account=false&amp;source=user&amp;sort=relevance&amp;facet_json=true&amp;page=0\">Jim Blandy</a>, coauthor of <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/programming-rust/9781491927274/\"><em>Programming Rust</em></a>, to see how his vision of Rust&#8217;s progress changed over the course of 2019. Last year, he noted that, “Rust has supported asynchronous programming in one form or another for a long time, but async functions provide a syntax for this sort of code that is a major improvement over what Rust has had before.” Did his hope for improvements to the Rust syntax come to fruition? Yes, eventually: Blandy explained that async/await syntax didn&#8217;t become stable until version 1.39, which was released November 7, 2019. &#8220;Originally, we were hoping async/await syntax could be part of the 2018 edition of Rust, but it took longer to get things right.&#8221; Still, he has high hopes for what async will mean for Rust in 2020: &#8220;Integrating async into the language lets the borrow checker understand what you&#8217;re doing, so asynchronous code can look like idiomatic Rust.&#8221; And as Blandy points out, the Rust ecosystem is acting quickly to take advantage of the language&#8217;s new expressiveness.</p>\\n<p>The Rust community is also excited about WebAssembly, which this year became a theoretical replacement to C/FFI for ecosystems that need portable, high-performance modules. And as Rust expert <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/oscon-2019/9781492050643/9781492050643-video325934\">Nathan Stocks</a> notes, &#8220;You get light sandboxing as well!&#8221; What impressed Stocks most was &#8220;how much of the theory had been prototyped and demonstrated successfully.”</p>\\n<blockquote><p>I had previously thought of WebAssembly purely as a compilation target to run code from non-JS languages in the browser. The addition of the ability to consume web assembly from any language outside the browser was mind-bending.</p></blockquote>\\n<h2>Swift</h2>\\n<p>The biggest stories in Swift last year were the releases of <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/\">SwiftUI</a>, Apple&#8217;s newest framework for designing user interfaces across all Apple devices, and <a href=\"https://www.tensorflow.org/swift\">Swift for TensorFlow</a>, a platform for deep learning and differentiable programming integrating Google&#8217;s TensorFlow framework with Swift. SwiftUI, as <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/oscon-2019/9781492050643/9781492050643-video325927\">Timirah James</a> explains, &#8220;has already gained so much traction amongst developers (rightfully so) with its declarative nature and is already being seen as a possible future successor to UIKit.&#8221; As for Swift for TensorFlow, <a href=\"https://secretlab.institute/2019/11/08/first-steps-swift-for-tensorflow/\">Paris Buttfield-Addison</a> calls it &#8220;a radical new use for Swift.&#8221; He explains, &#8220;Swift has always been a great app development and systems programming language, and is a great up-and-coming web and back-end development language, but now, with Swift for TensorFlow, it&#8217;s a powerful ML framework, too.&#8221; Here&#8217;s why:</p>\\n<blockquote><p>Swift for TensorFlow is developed by a team that includes the original creator of Swift, Chris Lattner, and provides (or will, when it&#8217;s done) everything you need for machine learning and numerical computing. Most surprisingly is the full first-class support for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differentiable_programming\">differentiable programming</a> with automatic differentiation, which is made possible by Swift&#8217;s underlying compiler framework and design.</p>\\n<p>Full in-language differentiable programming will make a whole collection of previously impossible things possible: the best example is being able to use a standard programming debugger to step through backpropagation and debug derivatives when you&#8217;re building a neural network.</p>\\n<p>Swift for TensorFlow also brings full Python support to Swift, allowing data scientists to mix and match the useful and familiar Python frameworks they need, with clean expressive Swift code.</p></blockquote>\\n<p>Looking ahead, both James and Buttfield-Addison are excited to see the new directions Swift takes, with James pointing to &#8220;Swift adoption across different communities and stacks beyond mobile, especially in the serverless realm,&#8221; and Buttfield-Addison calling out &#8220;amazing web development frameworks, like <a href=\"https://www.kitura.io/\">Kitura</a>, and all sorts of amazing frameworks for niche areas&#8230;such as <a href=\"https://github.com/KarthikRIyer/swiftplot\">SwiftPlot</a>, which is a Swift native version of the ubiquitous Matplotlib from Python.&#8221;</p>\\n<h2>What lies ahead?</h2>\\n<p>Change is inevitable, and as programming languages continue to lean in to optimization for new trends in the cloud, microservices, big data, and machine learning, each language and its ecosystem will continue to adapt in its own unique way. Big releases may be on the horizon in 2020 for certain languages—C++20 will be released this summer and Scala 3.0 is expected in late 2020—but what’s clear is even the smallest changes can cause huge waves in the daily lives of programmers.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/hQQrteWShco\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Eleven studies fit their eligibility criteria. [&#8230;] The emerging evidence base is also pretty clear. Those who are radicalized and/or commit acts of terrorism have generally been exposed to radicalizing content. Exposure to this content leads to affective, emotional, and behavioral change at each stage of the process. Of course, some of these studies have relatively small sample sizes, and are only focused on specific types of terrorists or geographical contexts. The key now is to replicate and build upon this preliminary evidence to give us a sense of not just whether exposure to ideological content in the online environment causes violent extremism, but also how, in what contexts and for whom?

Reactions have been very mixed; Techdirt has the <a href=\"https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20191210/21054943552/twitter-makes-bet-protocols-over-platforms.shtm\">best analysis</a> I’ve seen. <a href=\"https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/201x/2019/12/11/BlueSky\">Tim Bray’s</a> appropriately skeptical take is also very good. Certainly, we’d be in better shape now, though, if Twitter hadn’t decided a few years back that it didn’t need its developer ecosystem.</li>\\n<li>Fred Benenson mentions <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fredbenenson/status/1211722562570309634\">topic-focused micro social networks</a> in a tweet. This is a theme that I’ve seen coming from several directions lately; I’ve seen <a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a> explained as a collective of topic-focused networks, it’s a possible direction that Twitter itself could take with Dorsey’s proposal for open social network protocols. If Facebook’s hegemony is going to end, this may be how. The only way to compete with a monopoly is to change the game.</li>\\n<li>There are also proposals for open standards for <a href=\"https://www.cloudera.com/about/news-and-blogs/press-releases/2019-12-11-industry-call-to-define-universal-open-standards-for-machine-learning-operations-and-governance.html\">machine learning operations and governance</a> coming from Cloudera. It must be open standards month.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Security trends</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>It’s always a safe bet that cybersecurity is going to get <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/2020-is-when-cybersecurity-gets-even-weirder-so-get-ready\">weirder</a>. There’s a lot of angst about deep fakes and phishing, but the biggest struggle will be with <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/security/failure-modes-in-machine-learning\">attacks against AI</a>. Nevertheless, the ground truth with computer crime is that “criminal” isn’t a job you get by being smart. The biggest problem will continue to be the annoying, primitive, and lucrative attacks that companies haven’t responded to for the past decade.</li>\\n<li>Here’s a commercial implementation of a technique I suggested for more secure biometric authentication: the “<a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/news/372302/this-ring-uses-a-fake-fingerprint-to-protect-your-biometric\">burner fingerprint.</a>” My suggestion had a more subversive flavor (3D print a “fingerprint”; use that for ID; when concerned about device safety, such as when traveling through customs, throw the fingerprint in the nearest trash can; print a new copy at your leisure). This doesn’t quite go all the way, but they’ve clearly got the idea.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<h2>Other trends</h2>\\n<ul>\\n<li>With <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/braket/\">Braket</a>, Amazon adds itself to the short list of vendors that are making quantum computing available in the cloud. Amazon doesn’t have (and isn’t starting) its own cloud effort; they’ve bought machines from existing vendors that represent different approaches to quantum computing (D-Wave, Rigetti, and IonQ). Whether or not these are the right approaches, Amazon’s thesis that most quantum computing will be in the cloud is almost certainly correct.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/TZtzDDb3-V4\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Figure out beforehand what the author is trying to accomplish in the book. 2.

Read through the book actively, taking notes. 4. “Steelman” the argument, reworking it so that you find it as convincing and clear as you can possibly make it. 5. Find someone else—usually a roommate—and bore them to death by making them listen to you set out your “steelmanned” version of the argument. 6. Go back over the book again, giving it a sympathetic but not credulous reading. 7. Then you will be in a good position to figure out what the weak points of this strongest-possible argument version might be. 8. Test the major assertions and interpretations against reality: do they actually make sense of and in the context of the world as it truly is? 9. Decide what you think of the whole. 10. Then comes the task of cementing your interpretation, your reading, into your mind so that it becomes part of your intellectual panoply for the future.</i></li>\\n<li><a href=\"https://perkeep.org/\">Perkeep</a> &#8212; Camlistore gets a new name. <i>A set of open source formats, protocols, and software for modeling, storing, searching, sharing, and synchronizing data in the post-PC era.

They propose ideas to transform today’s winner-take-all economy into a more entrepreneurial <em>and</em> egalitarian society in their new book, <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/gz0V9QW0d00uMS0rF000gPB\"><em>Innovation + Equality: How to Create a Future That Is More Star Trek Than Terminator</em></a><em>.</em> In a recent opinion piece for the <em>Hill</em>, the authors assert that we’re “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/wMVSQ9rFW0000Buh00d0A0P\">running out of excuses for high inequality</a>.” You’ll find <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Q0PS0VM0FB0Wd0Qur00i9B0\">an excerpt from the book, followed by an interview with the authors</a>, in the <em>Economist</em>.</p>\\n<h2><em>The Meritocracy Trap</em></h2>\\n<p>Yale Law School professor Daniel Markovits scrutinizes the great American faith that talent and hard work will result in success and upward mobility, and finds it entirely unjustified in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/XrW0BjM0Q000SP9Vd00uFC0\"><em>The Meritocracy Trap: How America’s Foundational Myth Feeds Inequality, Dismantles the Middle Class, and Devours the Elite</em></a>. His sobering revelations include the role of higher education in deepening the class divide, as the concentration of wealthy kids in prestigious schools continues to grow and the middle class continues to shrink, <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/dr0WBuDQPd0SV00M9k000F0\">as is detailed in this </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/dr0WBuDQPd0SV00M9k000F0\"><em>New York Times</em></a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/dr0WBuDQPd0SV00M9k000F0\"> review</a>. In this interview from the <em>Nation</em>, Markovits explains how “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/TlQFP0B0u000VME00W9drS0\">the meritocracy is making us miserable</a>.” Listen in as <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/imPF0QMuBFW00r000Vd0S09\">Markovits expands on his premise on </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/imPF0QMuBFW00r000Vd0S09\"><em>The Ezra Klein Show</em></a>, or read <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/UdnB09S0WM0FrP00uQ000GV\">this adapted excerpt in the </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/UdnB09S0WM0FrP00uQ000GV\"><em>Atlantic</em></a>.</p>\\n<h2><em>The Code of Capital</em></h2>\\n<p>Columbia Law School professor Katharina Pistor explains the many ways our legal system perpetuates today’s extreme concentration of wealth in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/b0000rMWPFH0SBuo000dV9Q\"><em>The Code of Capital: How the Law Creates Wealth and Inequality</em></a>. The <em>Boston Review</em> extolls Pistor’s tome along with two other alarming books that <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Ld90SM00u0IP0FpVB0W0r0Q\">call out structural injustices and call for a thorough revision of economic imperatives</a>. Pistor occasionally writes for <em>Project Syndicate</em>; in her latest piece she declares, “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/NM00JFdr000uBPS0qQ90V0W\">If wealth is justified, so is a wealth tax</a>.”</p>\\n<h2><em>Coders</em></h2>\\n<p>Technology journalist Clive Thompson, who writes for the <em>New York Times Magazine</em> and <em>Wired</em>, lays out how those who create the algorithms create the world and the ways we live in it in his book <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Bu00rF0SQ00090PM0VKWBdr\"><em>Coders: The Making of a New Tribe and the Remaking of the World</em></a>.

The <em>New York Times</em> review of <em>Coders</em> describes the book as “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/o00MQ00tP00uBF09VSMrdW0\">a journey—if you dare—into the minds of Silicon Valley programmers</a>.”</p>\\n<h2><em>Make, Think, Imagine</em></h2>\\n<p>In <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/o00NQ00uP00uBF09VSMrdW0\"><em>Make, Think, Imagine: Engineering the Future of Civilization</em></a>, John Browne, an engineering apprentice who rose through the ranks to become CEO of BP from 1995 to 2007 and served as president of the UK’s Royal Academy of Engineering, asserts that technological progress can and must be harnessed to better civilization and spread prosperity&#8230;even today, as visions of a techno-dystopia can seem overwhelming. Browne discusses his faith in engineering, technology, and innovation in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/I0u0OFV0W9BvQr0d0P0MS00\">this Book Talk hosted by Columbia University&#8217;s School of International and Public Affairs</a>. <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/s0PP0Wu0VMQw0F0d9B00r0S\">This </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/s0PP0Wu0VMQw0F0d9B00r0S\"><em>Financial Times</em> review</a> emphasizes Browne’s faith in imagination, planning, and design to build a better society.</p>\\n<h2><em>Learning by Doing</em></h2>\\n<p>While it’s not a new book, we didn’t cover <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/I0u0QFV0W9BxQr0d0P0MS00\"><em>Learning by Doing: The Real Connection Between Innovation, Wages, and Wealth</em></a> when it was published in 2015, and it deserves a place in our Next Economy reading list. Tim O’Reilly liked it so much that he devoted a chapter to it in his own 2017 book, <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/eQ0VRS00000MFP0d9uyWB0r\"><em>WTF? What’s the Future and Why It’s Up to Us</em></a>. Entrepreneur and economist James Bessen, the executive director of the Technology &amp; Policy Research Initiative at Boston University School of Law, extolls learning on the job as the path to prosperity and advocates for policy changes that provide incentives for employers to put their workers on that path. Bessen was a speaker on the series <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/yuPFVdBQ0r0WSMS09z00000\"><em>Talks at Google</em></a> in 2017 and a guest on <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/K00d9FM00WPT0ArVB0uQ0S0\">Russ Roberts’s <em>EconTalk</em> podcast</a> in 2016. The <em>Atlantic</em> adapted an excerpt from his book: “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/R00W9VuMdr0000B0FUSPBQ0\">Scarce Skills, Not Scarce Jobs</a>.”</p>\\n<h2><em>Hedge</em></h2>\\n<p>In his 2018 book, <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/kF0CW0Q00PB00MrdVu0V90S\"><em>Hedge: A Greater Safety Net for the Entrepreneurial Age</em></a><em>,</em> Nicolas Colin, cofounder and director of the European investment firm <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/c0900dBF0WQM0urSD0VWP00\">The Family</a> and a prolific writer, argues that as we progress from the industrial age into an evermore digital world of work—one of faster-growing companies, rampant entrepreneurship, and a growing population of independent workers and gig economy participants—it’s increasingly important for society to rethink and reinforce its safety net. In <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/R00W9VuMdr0000B0FXSPEQ0\">this Medium post</a>, Colin raises the prospect that China—not the US—will be the architect of “the Great Safety Net 2.0.” He makes the case that Silicon Valley should throw out its playbook and start caring about the world in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/c0900dBF0WQM0urSF0VYP00\">this essay</a> from <em>Forbes</em>. Colin made an appearance on <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/r90Z0S0P0MGWVQFuB00d0r0\"><em>Talks at Google</em></a> this spring to discuss <em>Hedge</em> and share his ideas about technology, policy, and the need to upgrade our institutions.</p>\\n<h2><em>The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust</em></h2>\\n<p>Cryptocurrencies have been subject to scandal and subterfuge, but the decentralized, distributed ledger technology underpinning the rise of Bitcoin and its brethren (a.k.a. the blockchain) has evolved to be used in many industries for authentication of information. Kevin Werbach, professor of legal studies and business ethics at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, recounts this evolution and describes the potential of the blockchain as a type of legal technology that can create tremendous business and social value in his book <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/NM000Fdr000uBQS0IQ90V0W\"><em>The Blockchain and the New Architecture of Trust</em></a>. Werbach weighed in on Facebook’s now back-burnered cryptocurrency, Libra, in the <em>New York Times</em>, positing it as “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/AQ0J09FM00QruBd00W010VS\">the social network’s last, best hope to regain public trust</a>.” The <em>New York Times</em> covered Werbach’s book, along with another blockchain book, in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/hWBu29M00F000drQQ000SKV\">this review</a>. <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/ZMQ9B0uLr0000d0V300WSFQ\">Here’s Werbach’s <em>Talks at Google</em> appearance</a> to discuss his book.</p>\\n<h2><em>Digital Minimalism</em></h2>\\n<p>Georgetown University computer science professor Cal Newport had an instant hit on his hands with <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/O0Q0B9dS0000QFW40M0ruVM\"><em>Digital Minimalism: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World</em></a>; he became known as the Marie Kondo of mobile phones for his sensible advice for staying centered in a world filled with addictive devices by making intentional choices and using tech to support your goals rather than enabling it to use you. Word of this book spread far beyond the usual Next Economy media suspects. Newport took to the pages of <em>Outside</em> with tips for readers to maximize their free time: “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Ld90SM00u05Q0FNVB0W0r0Q\">To Upgrade Your Leisure, Downgrade Your Phone</a>.” <em>GQ</em> interviewed Newport about <em>Digital Minimalism</em> and “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/quSF0r0VWO0Q9Q00M0B600d\">why we’ll look back at our smartphones like cigarettes</a>.” <em>New Yorker</em> writer Jia Tolentino road-tested Newport’s advice to find out firsthand “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Bu00PF0SQ00090QM0V7WBdr\">what it takes to put your phone away</a>.”</p>\\n<h2>New from O’Reilly: The cloud and beyond</h2>\\n<p>Our tireless editors don’t just sit around reading great books; they’re continually on the lookout for savvy experts who can translate their skills and knowledge into books, videos, online courses, and other learning experiences to give you the most effective tools to master what you need to know to thrive in the Next Economy.

And AI processes have unique capabilities that can address an increasingly diverse array of automation tasks, tasks that defy what traditional procedural logic and programming can handle—for example: image recognition, summarization, labeling, complex monitoring, and response.</p>\\n<p>In fact, in our 2019 surveys, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/how-companies-are-putting-aI-to-work-through-deep-learning.pdf\">more than half of the respondents</a> said AI (deep learning, specifically) will be part of their future projects and products—and a <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/data/free/files/the-state-of-machine-learning-adoption-in-the-enterprise.pdf\">majority of companies</a> are starting to adopt machine learning.</p>\\n<h2>The line between data and AI is blurring</h2>\\n<p>Access to the amount of data necessary for AI, proven use cases for both consumer and enterprise AI, and more-accessible tools for building applications have grown dramatically, spurring new AI projects and pilots.</p>\\n<p>To stay competitive, data scientists need to at least dabble in machine and deep learning. At the same time, current AI systems rely on data-hungry models, so AI experts will require high-quality data and a secure and efficient data pipeline. As these disciplines merge, data professionals will need a basic understanding of AI, and AI experts will need a foundation in solid data practices—and, likely, a more formal commitment to data governance.</p>\\n<p>That’s why we decided to merge the 2020 <a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata-data-ai\">O’Reilly AI and Strata Data Conferences</a> in San Jose, London, and New York.</p>\\n<h2>New (and simpler) tools, infrastructures, and hardware are being developed</h2>\\n<p>We’re in a highly empirical era for machine learning. Tools for machine learning development need to account for the growing importance of data, experimentation, model search, model deployment, and monitoring. At the same time, managing the various stages of AI development is getting easier with the growing ecosystem of open source frameworks and libraries, cloud platforms, proprietary software tools, and SaaS.</p>\\n<h2>New models and methods are emerging</h2>\\n<p>While deep learning continues to drive a lot of interesting research, most end-to-end solutions are <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/building-tools-for-the-ai-applications-of-tomorrow\">hybrid systems</a>. In 2020, we‘ll hear more about the essential role of other components and methods—including Bayesian and other <a href=\"http://www.argmin.net/2018/06/25/outsider-rl/\">model-based</a> methods, tree search, evolution, knowledge graphs, simulation platforms, and others. We also expect to see new use cases for reinforcement learning emerge. And we just might begin to see exciting developments in machine learning methods that <em>aren’t</em> based on neural networks.</p>\\n<h2>New developments enable new applications</h2>\\n<p>Developments in computer vision and speech/voice (“eyes and ears”) technology help drive the creation of new products and services that can make personalized, custom-sized clothing, drive autonomous harvesting robots, or provide the logic for proficient chatbots. Work on robotics (“arms and legs”) and autonomous vehicles is compelling and closer to market.</p>\\n<p>There’s also a new wave of startups targeting “traditional data” with new AI and automation technologies. This includes text (new natural language processing (NLP) and natural language understanding (NLU) solutions, chatbots, etc.), time series and temporal data, transactional data, and logs.</p>\\n<p>And traditional enterprise software vendors and startups are rushing to build AI applications that target specific industries or domains. This is in line with findings in a recent <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/artificial-intelligence/ai-adoption-advances-but-foundational-barriers-remain\">McKinsey survey</a>: enterprises are using AI in areas where they’ve already invested in basic analytics.</p>\\n<h2>Handling fairness—working from the premise that all data has built-in biases</h2>\\n<p>Taking a cue from the software quality assurance world, those working on AI models need to assume their data has built-in or systemic bias and other issues related to fairness—like the assumption that bugs exist in software, and that formal processes are needed to detect, correct, and address those issues.</p>\\n<p>Detecting bias and ensuring fairness doesn’t come easy and is most effective when subject to review and validation from a diverse set of perspectives. That means building in intentional diversity to the processes used to detect unfairness and bias—cognitive diversity, socioeconomic diversity, cultural diversity, physical diversity—to help improve the process and mitigate the risk of missing something critical.</p>\\n<h2>Machine deception continues to be a serious challenge</h2>\\n<p>Deepfakes have <a href=\"http://www.hao-li.com/publications/papers/cvpr2019workshopsPWLADF.pdf\">tells that automated detection systems can look for</a>: unnatural blinking patterns, inconsistent lighting, facial distortion, inconsistencies between mouth movements and speech, and the lack of small but distinct individual facial movements (how Donald Trump purses his lips before answering a question, for example).</p>\\n<p>But deepfakes are getting better. As 2020 is a US election year, automated detection methods will have to be developed as fast as new forms of machine deception are launched. But automated detection may not be enough. Detection models themselves can be used to stay ahead of the detectors. Within a couple months of the release of an algorithm that spots unnatural blinking patterns for example, the next generation of deepfake generators had incorporated blinking into their systems.</p>\\n<p>Programs that can automatically watermark and identify images when taken or altered or using blockchain technology to verify content from trusted sources could be a partial fix, but as deepfakes improve, trust in digital content diminishes. Regulation may be enacted, but the path to effective regulation that doesn’t interfere with innovation is far from clear.</p>\\n<h2>To fully take advantage of AI technologies, you’ll need to retrain your entire organization</h2>\\n<p>As AI tools become easier to use, AI use cases proliferate and AI projects are deployed, and cross-functional teams are being pulled into AI projects. Data literacy will be required from employees outside traditional data teams—in fact, <a href=\"https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-do-you-speak-data/\">Gartner expects</a> that 80% of organizations will start to roll out internal data literacy initiatives to upskill their workforce by 2020.</p>\\n<p>But training is an <em>ongoing</em> endeavor, and to succeed in implementing AI and ML, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/ideas/ai-and-machine-learning-will-require-retraining-your-entire-organization\">companies will need to take a more holistic approach toward retraining their entire workforces</a>. This may be the most difficult, but most rewarding, process for many organizations to undertake. The opportunity for teams to plug into a broader community on a <em>regular</em> basis to see a wide cross-section of successful AI implementations and solutions is also critical.</p>\\n<p>Retraining also means rethinking diversity. Reinforcing and expanding on how important diversity is to detecting fairness and bias issues, diversity becomes even more critical for organizations looking to successfully implement truly useful AI models and related technologies. As we expect most AI projects to augment human tasks, incorporating the human element in a broad, inclusive manner becomes a key factor for widespread acceptance and success.</p>\\n<aside data-type=\"sidebar\">Thanks to Ben Lorica for his insights and help with this piece.</p>\\n</aside>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/2GMAWmBhooA\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<h2>We need to rethink the role of the programmer</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Look for the industry to become more stratified and specialized. The programming world will increasingly be split between highly trained professionals and people who don’t have a deep background but have a lot of experience building things. The former group builds tools, frameworks, languages, and platforms; the latter group connects things and builds websites, mobile apps, and the like. These two types of programmers have always existed, mixing fluidly. We just haven’t recognized the distinction, and that’s going to change. A good analogy is plumbing. If you need to install a toilet, you call a plumber: they know how to connect things together. There are jobs for people who design plumbing fixtures, but you wouldn’t want them working in your bathroom.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>We need to think about how programming is taught</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Like reading, some people learn how to code with little training, and others don’t. But as with reading, we shouldn’t accept a world in which some people enter primary school programming-literate, and those that don’t have to wait until high school. We’ll need teachers who are trained in teaching programming—specifically, teaching programming in the early grades. We already have programming environments that are optimized for teaching children, including <a href=\"https://scratch.mit.edu/\">Scratch</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alice.org/\">Alice</a>, and their relatives. And don’t discount the role gaming could play. <em>Minecraft</em> has unwittingly taught a generation of grade-schoolers how to program in Java.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We also need to build bridges for people with great programming skills but without a deep computer science background—the plumbers—to enter the professional market. Some of those bridges exist already; they include the many boot camps and schools like <a href=\"https://generalassemb.ly/\">General Assembly</a> and <a href=\"https://www.holbertonschool.com/\">Holberton</a>. These are distinct from college degree-granting programs (the traditional computer science major) and serve a different purpose. They’re more like vocational education programs: They’re focused on practice, with minimal emphasis on theory. They’re about learning to program in a professional context—working with a web platform, a database, or even an AI platform—but not about developing those platforms or databases. They’re for those who say, “Why should I know how to program quicksort? If I want to sort something, I’ll call a library function.” That’s just fine, and we shouldn’t pretend that it isn’t.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In contrast, CS majors should continue to be exposed to and work with theory and algorithms—not because they’re going to write their own quicksort but because we need people who can develop and implement new algorithms, and the best way to learn is to practice on algorithms we already understand. You don’t need to be good at math to program, but you do need math to push computing forward—particularly if you’re interested in data science or artificial intelligence.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>We need new, more sophisticated programming tools</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>In “<a href=\"https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5656-hidden-technical-debt-in-machine-learning-systems.pdf\">Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems</a>,” the authors—a group of researchers and engineers from Google—argue that machine learning is a relatively small part of any application. Much of the rest is wiring things together: building data pipelines, connecting the application to the serving infrastructure, providing for monitoring. It&#8217;s not glamorous, but it needs to be done, and done correctly. I&#8217;d bet that much more downtime results from bad plumbing than from bad implementations of ML algorithms. Rather than relying on our current crop of languages, I wonder whether or not there are better languages for this part of the enterprise. It’s long seemed strange to me that programming languages aren’t all that different from what they were in the 1960s and 1970s: line-oriented, alphanumeric texts, most often in fixed-width type. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming\">Functional languages</a> date back to the 1950s, and the earliest roots of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming\">object-oriented programming</a> aren’t much later. What would it mean to imagine other kinds of languages? Work is already being done on this front. There have been a surprising number of visual languages, which let users create programs using symbols or other graphic elements rather than text—although most have been unsuccessful. But even in popular languages like Scratch, we’re dealing with a simple mapping of visual objects to a traditional programming language: a “clamp” is a “loop,” a “variable” is a “box,” and so on. Is it possible to push even further beyond traditional programming languages? What would a programming language designed for plumbing look like? And would it give us better and more fruitful ways to think about the interconnections between systems? <em>— Mike Loukides</em></p>\\n\\n\\n<hr>\\n<h2>Upcoming events</h2>\\n<p><a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/conferences\">O’Reilly conferences</a> combine expert insights from industry leaders with hands-on guidance about today’s most important technology topics.</p>\\n<p>We hope you’ll join us at our upcoming events:</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture/sa-ny\">O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference in New York</a>, February 23-26, 2020</p>\\n<p><a href=\"https://conferences.oreilly.com/strata-data-ai/stai-ca\">The O&#8217;Reilly Strata Data &amp; AI Conference in San Jose</a>, March 15-18, 2020</p><img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/4zcQIcWGpJE\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

In a recent interview from the public radio show <em>Marketplace</em>, Philippon explains how “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/yuwF000Q0r0WSMx00300000\">market concentration and low competition has become the new normal in America</a>.” You can <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/DFy00040SM000w0uWQ000r0\">read this adapted excerpt in the </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/DFy00040SM000w0uWQ000r0\"><em>Atlantic</em></a>.

The book’s authors also wrote a <em>Times</em> opinion piece filled with more straightforward data visualizations depicting the inequity of the US tax system: “<a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/E0r0F008MC00Q00S0w00W0u\">How to Tax Our Way Back to Justice</a>.”</p>\\n<h2><em>Good Economics for Hard Times</em></h2>\\n<p>Newly minted Nobel laureates Abhijit V. Banerjee and Esther Duflo—a husband-and-wife team of economics professors at MIT—expand on their award-winning research in their new book, <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/CM00090DW0wF0Qr0000uS00\"><em>Good Economics for Hard Times</em></a>. They pull apart conceptions perceived as common knowledge and dig into the facts about societal forces including inequality, migration, globalization, and taxation. <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/x0F0000w0Eu0WQM0ar000S0\">Here’s a glowing review from the </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/x0F0000w0Eu0WQM0ar000S0\"><em>Guardian</em></a>.

You bet</a>!”—draws on both this book and <em>The Triumph of Injustice</em> to make its argument.

Bill Gates has given a great deal of thought to the book; <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/XrW00fM0Q000Sw00000uFJ0\">in this review</a> he agrees with most of its premises while arguing that Collier should expand his framework for rectifying capitalism’s excesses beyond the levels of global, national, company, and family to include community.

Collier discusses his book in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/K0000FM00WwL0hr000uQ0S0\">this video from Oxford’s Blavatnik School of Government</a>.</p>\\n<h2><em>The Enlightened Capitalists</em></h2>\\n<p>James O’Toole, professor emeritus at the USC Marshall School of Business, founding director of the Neely Center for Ethical Leadership and Decision Making, and author of 17 books, turns his eye to business leaders who try to balance profitability and social purpose in his latest work, <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/V0Mi000rwu0S000FW000MQ0\"><em>The Enlightened Capitalists: Cautionary Tales of Business Pioneers Who Tried to Do Well by Doing Good</em></a><em>.</em> As the subtitle forewarns, the impulse to build societal good into a corporation’s business practices has its perils; O’Toole offers case studies in the form of portraits of successful entrepreneurs who lost control of their enterprises to executives who did not share their belief that a company should do more than chase profits, including improving workers’ lives, advancing women in the workplace, and advocating for other social issues such as the environment. <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Aw0j00FM00Qru0000W0N00S\">This review in the </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Aw0j00FM00Qru0000W0N00S\"><em>Financial Times</em></a> points out that more recent business structure innovations—such as B Corporations, employee-owned enterprises, and cooperatives—offer better opportunities for compatibility of capitalism and corporate benevolence. <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/U0k000S0WM0Frw00uQ000O0\">In this </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/U0k000S0WM0Frw00uQ000O0\"><em>Recode Decode</em></a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/U0k000S0WM0Frw00uQ000O0\"> interview</a> by Kara Swisher, O’Toole tears into the Corporate Roundtable’s recent redefinition of the purpose of a corporation to care for more than short-term returns, expressing doubt that leaders of US corporations can “walk the walk.”</p>\\n<h2>Tales from two of today’s enlightened capitalists</h2>\\n<p><em>The Enlightened Capitalists</em> might be the perfect book to read as a prelude to recent autobiographies by two strikingly different business leaders who have stood up for social issues to the tune of millions of dollars. In <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/TlQFw000u0000MP00W00rS0\"><em>It’s How We Play the Game: Build a Business. Take a Stand. Make a Difference.</em></a>, Ed Stack recounts how he built the DICK’S Sporting Goods empire from his father’s two Dick’s Bait and Tackle stores, always intending to be a force for good in the communities where the stores are located. Distressed by the rise in school shootings, Stack raised the age for in-store gun purchases to 21 and pulled semiautomatics from his shelves in the wake of the Parkland, Florida, attack, destroying $5 million in inventory and angering conservative lawmakers, the NRA, and a large part of his customer base while at the same time earning accolades for placing principles above profits. <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/z0000rW0000MQQwuF0m0S00\">The </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/z0000rW0000MQQwuF0m0S00\"><em>Washington Post</em></a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/z0000rW0000MQQwuF0m0S00\"> describes Stack’s bold move and its ramifications here</a>, and Stack recounts his actions in the broader context of US gun control in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/n0F00Rn000QW0SM00u00rw0\">this CBS News interview</a>.</p>\\n<p>Some people give discreetly and anonymously, but Salesforce founder, board chair, and co-CEO Marc Benioff is not that kind of guy. Benioff has famously put millions of dollars behind efforts to combat the homeless crisis in San Francisco, <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/NM00TF0r000u0wS0pQ0000W\">supporting legislation to raise taxes on large corporations to help the homeless</a> (and getting into Twitter wars with his tech CEO peers who disagreed with Prop C) and, more recently, donating $30 million to launch the <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/c000000F0WQM0urSq00Uw00\">UCSF Benioff Homelessness and Housing Initiative</a>. In <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/kF0oW0Q00w000Mr00u0S00S\"><em>Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change</em></a>—written with Salesforce EVP of global strategic affairs Monica Langley—Benioff presents his vision for the role of business in making the world a better place and discusses how his company’s core values of trust, customer success, innovation, and equality; a commitment to giving back to society; and a focus on corporate culture have created a powerful competitive advantage. Benioff recounts his efforts to close Salesforce’s gender pay gap in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/irwF0QMu0VW00r000000S00\">this excerpt from </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/irwF0QMu0VW00r000000S00\"><em>Trailblazer</em></a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/irwF0QMu0VW00r000000S00\"> in </a><a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/irwF0QMu0VW00r000000S00\"><em>Wired</em></a>.</p>\\n<h2><em>More from Less</em></h2>\\n<p>Andrew McAfee, cofounder and codirector of the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy and a principal research scientist at the MIT Sloan School of Management, expresses a positive vision for the future propelled by the “four horsemen of the optimist”—effective capitalism, technological progress, public awareness of environmental issues, and responsive, effective government—in <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/trS0000wF00Ws00QM0000uW\"><em>More from Less: The Surprising Story of How We Finally Learned to Prosper Using Fewer Resources—and What Happens Next</em></a>. He asserts that free markets and tech innovation will enable people to prosper while government institutions and the free press will rein in rapacious greed and protect against social and environmental harm—beliefs that seem inconceivable at this point in US history, as citizens lose faith in crumbling institutions while a cynical administration fights to maintain power. Part of his optimism derives from the fact that the US standard of living has risen over the past two decades while American consumption of resources like water, metals, and building materials declines. McAfee’s concept of the decoupling of growth and environmental degradation—at least in prosperous, developed economies—comes into question in many reviews of his book; <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/V0Mt000rwu0S000FW000XQ0\">this post from the MIT Initiative on the Digital Economy blog</a> addresses those qualms. <a href=\"http://link.oreilly.com/Fu0MW00Yu0F000w0000SrQ0\">Here’s an enlightening interview with McAfee</a> by Russ Roberts in his <em>EconTalk</em> podcast.

This concept allows us to bring together and partially explain a set of behavioral anomalies identified across four distinct domains of decision-making: choice under risk, choice under ambiguity, belief updating, and survey expectations about economic variables. [&#8230;] Building on existing models of noisy Bayesian cognition, we formally propose that cognitive uncertainty generates these patterns by inducing people to compress probabilities toward a mental default of 50:50. We document experimentally that the responses of individuals with higher cognitive uncertainty indeed exhibit stronger compression of probabilities in choice under risk and ambiguity, belief updating, and survey expectations.</i></li>\\n</ol>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/yO5DCLMmMec\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

It&#8217;s not about building a nine month strategic plan, and then building a huge team. It&#8217;s about picking a problem—making better predictions or automating something, or trying to optimize a business process—and go give it a try.&#8221; (01:20)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>O’Reilly expands on the iterative concept, noting that working iteratively helps get beyond the hype and the “all-or-nothing” perspective AI hype fosters. “AI has had so much hype attached to it,” he explains, “that everybody comes away with a sort of binary: it&#8217;s either the complete self-driving car that didn’t really work or is not doing as well as they thought, so even the big dudes can&#8217;t do it.&nbsp; So therefore, it’s over-hyped, or it&#8217;s nothing. And part of what the AI Ladder gets across is, yes, there are very futuristic projects that tend to represent AI in people&#8217;s minds, but there&#8217;s actually a series of steps used to get there. So companies think, &#8216;Well, what&#8217;s that one big win that we could have like the one that Google&#8217;s working on?&#8217; And that&#8217;s not the right way to think about this. You want to get up there, but you have to start at the bottom of the ladder, and you have to do a bunch of work to get ready, and then you do a bunch of small projects and you gradually build your competency, rather than simply saying, &#8216;I’ve got to get some of that AI magic, so I’ll go to a vendor who promises to do something that sounds magical to me.\\'&#8221; (01:54)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The work, Thomas says, starts with the “lingua franca of the AI world,” which Thomas and O’Reilly list as such languages as Python, TensorFlow, and PyTorch. “This is computer science,” says Thomas, “and it&#8217;s computer science disguised as hard work. You better roll up your sleeves. … I think it’s hard for a lot of people to get their heads around the idea that whatever we&#8217;re doing today, we&#8217;re probably going to be doing something different in six to 12 months. So, it will take constant learning to do this well.” (03:22)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Communication is going to be key, Thomas notes, which is going to require a way to unlock normal human communication—in written form, spoken form, structured and unstructured text, etc.—to get to the real insights. “That&#8217;s why I say NLP is ultimately going to become this nervous system,” Thomas says, “where if you can do that very well; it&#8217;s going to make a big difference. And there are industry benchmarks on this. The newest one&#8217;s called SuperGLUE. … So we&#8217;re getting almost to a human level in NLP, and these benchmarks will continue to move the bar, which is good because it challenges us to be better. (11:12)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Thomas says his company encourages clients to take steps toward AI adoption because major factors are coming together to make this an opportune time to get on board early. “This is finally becoming a board-level topic for companies I interact with,” he said. “Just look at the economics: $16 trillion of GDP is expected to be accrued from AI between now and 2030. It&#8217;s hard to overlook numbers that big. Let&#8217;s say that&#8217;s off by 50%; it&#8217;s still a big number. So, there&#8217;s an economic piece. Adoption today—meaning companies that have seriously done something with AI—depending on who you believe, is somewhere between 4-8%. You take those two things—the biggest economic opportunity any of us will ever see in our lives, and very low adoption—that&#8217;s a pretty good opportunity to step into the moment and do something as a company.&#8221; (14:45)</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s important for companies to innovate in these areas, too, O’Reilly notes, because the problems we’re going to face in the coming decades are going to require it. “The thing I get most excited about is that we are growing our data universe, and we have to grow our “understanding universe” as well. You think about things like handheld DNA sensors. We had a demonstration of this device at our Science Foo Camp. They were using it to look at a virus that was affecting cassava roots in Africa&#8211;they literally were doing handheld gene sequencing in the field. Think about how compute power is going out to an edge like that, and you start adding up all of those edges&#8211;we had a presentation this morning, for example, about how a new crop disease or plague of insects, or whatever, in some part of the world could have an effect on commodity prices worldwide. That&#8217;s the kind of stuff we&#8217;re going to be building systems for so we’re increasingly able to respond in real time. When I look at the arc of history, the problems we&#8217;re going to be hitting in the 21st century are so large that we’ll need all the help we can get.&#8221; (15:36)</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/4glONYBD9m0\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

       "     'value': '<p>Although blockchain technology is still in its early days, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/how-social-forces-could-drive-blockchain-demand/\">momentum</a> has been building in the enterprise. While there has been much focus on blockchains in banking and payments, its impact has already extended far beyond finance. Here is a glimpse of just some of this work and the kind of intense learning that can be leveraged across industries.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Health care</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>With its high bar for data privacy and security, lessons learned in health care could inform development and practice in government and other regulation-heavy industries. Regulatory requirements make health care one of the more challenging industries to tackle, so change will take time to trickle down to patients in a way they really notice. But development has been underway for years already. Visionaries are hoping to leverage blockchains to provide a secure, universal data sharing infrastructure that can help solve decades-long problems endemic to the health care system. Because providers today don’t have a way to securely share data, there is hope that blockchain-driven collaboration could ultimately increase accuracy of diagnosis and coordination of treatment.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, MedRec is a system in development at MIT that seeks to make it possible for patients to manage their own records, giving permission to different providers to access and update data. The system is being tested with anonymized data, and could be used, for example, as a trusted central repository for vaccination, even if those vaccines were given by different providers. Gem and Tierion are startups working different aspects of data storage, verification and sharing (both partnered with Philips Healthcare), while Hu-manity.co partnered with IBM to give patients more control of their data and enable them to profit directly from sharing their data. MetLife can now pay claims instantly to expectant mothers who test positive for gestational diabetes—while this represents just a small sliver of business, it is easy to project how this learning could be extensible to other populations.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Real estate</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Pioneers are working to increase liquidity, ease administrative burden, and open up the possibility of new business models in real estate. Their work could inspire innovations in other spaces with similar characteristics. They are using the technology to record, track, and transfer land titles, deed, and liens, and to facilitate payments, leasing, and sales. They are even exploring new ways to fractionalize real estate through tokenization (programmable representations of value).</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The Swedish land registry authority, Lantmäteriet, has, with a diverse team of partners, been testing land registry on a private blockchain. Today, it can take months from the signing of a contract to register a sale, even though Lantmäteriet is already paperless and highly digitized. The registry is automating transactions on a blockchain, enabling buyers and sellers to digitally sign a bill of sale, with signatures verified automatically instead of at an agent’s office. When a land title changes hands, it would be verified via the blockchain, and recorded again. It’s still a long way until a blockchain-driven registry is widely available in Sweden, but estimates put taxpayers’ potential savings at over $100 million a year. In the U.S., the city of South Burlington in Vermont has also run pilots with land title and registry on a blockchain.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Platforms have emerged to facilitate the tokenization of real estate, which can help make an illiquid asset more liquid. Buyers purchase tokens, each representing a fraction of the asset. Last year, the owners of the St. Regis Aspen Resort in Colorado raised $18 million in this way, with each token valued at $1 USD.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Consumer packaged goods</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>A great deal of investment in blockchain technology has poured in from consumer packaged goods companies attracted by the promise of more supply chain transparency. Their challenging work—how, for example, do you digitize a strawberry?—could lay important groundwork for any industry looking to achieve more visibility of goods moving through their ecosystem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>More than 100 companies are involved with IBM’s Food Trust network, including many consumer packaged goods companies and grocery retailers. Consumers, retailers, and food safety organizations are demanding more transparency, and blockchain is looking to be a promising solution for this complex ecosystem.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Bumble Bee Foods is using a blockchain to achieve transparency in its supply chain all the way from the moment a tuna is caught by fishermen to arriving on grocery store shelves. The company is aiming to demonstrate provenance of its product to influence consumer preference and even pricing. Nestle has been testing blockchains in more than 10 projects, including IBM Food Trust, where it is using the technology to track provenance of ingredients in products like Gerber baby food.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Anheuser-Busch InBev is exploring a range of pilots. The brewing company is giving some consumers an option to upload their driver’s license information to a blockchain, which verifies age so they can then buy beer at a vending machine simply by scanning their phone. Anheuser-Busch InBev also has a partnership with BanQu that uses a blockchain to facilitate payments to farmers who don’t have bank accounts. In fast growing markets, like Africa, this could enable the company to meet demand more efficiently by making it possible to work with more farmers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Advertising</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Digital advertising depends on a complex ecosystem of advertisers, publishers, and middlemen, and is plagued by widespread fraud. Blockchain provides hope for smarter, more secure advertising that generates higher yields. Entrepreneurs and intrapreneurs are exploring many angles, including using blockchains for higher quality data, targeting, and reducing costs. This work could inform a range of industries that are operating with large ecosystems characterized by fraud or high-toll intermediaries.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>For example, Comcast and competitors Viacom and Spectrum Reach have partnered to launch Blockgraph, which seeks to enable more precise targeting without disclosing viewers’ personal information to advertisers. Brave is a new browser that sees to attack each layer of inefficiency in the browser ecosystem. This new model uses a blockchain to eliminate the middlemen that today take more than half the revenue. Instead of going to Google or Facebook, for example, advertisers will list directly onto Brave’s blockchain-based browser. Both advertisers and publishers get more value, and consumers get fewer but better targeted ads.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Insurance</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>The application of blockchain in the insurance industry is an area of great exploration. The technology is being targeted as a way to detect fraud, improve the efficiency of claims processing, and simplify the flow of data and payments between insurers and reinsurers. But it is also being explored as a key mechanism for innovative approaches to insurance. Blockchains (along with a new flood of IoT-driven data that can be used to calculate risk and monitor assets) could make it easier for insurers to offer granular protection that flexes and changes with individual needs. It drives costs down and enables unique identifiers, immutable tracking, and contracts that can be executed without a human—making it possible to make insurance work for smaller and smaller things or periods of time. This may also make it easier for non-insurers to bundle insurance with their products and services, creating new, innovative packaging that drives customer preference in a broad range of industries.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Insurance giant Allianz SE has been testing a range of blockchain applications. For example, through a joint venture, the company is testing flight-delay insurance that could be automatically initiated as soon as a flight is delayed by the insured delay time. It is also involved with a project to speed insurance payments to health providers. State Farm is working on a blockchain to speed the process in which insurers seek partial reimbursements for claims from other insurers involved with the claim, today a painful process with high administrative costs.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<h2>Momentum takes shape across the business landscape</h2>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These industries provide just a glimpse of the kinds of projects that are building momentum. Just about every industry has both established and disruptive players looking to use blockchain technology to evolve the way business is done. According to Deloitte in their <a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/insights/us/en/topics/understanding-blockchain-potential/global-blockchain-survey.html\">2019 Global Blockchain Survey</a>, “the question for executives is no longer, ‘will blockchain work?’ but, ‘how can we make blockchain work for us?”. While many enterprise projects tend to be lodged in the deep back office, they create a foundation that could be leveraged to one day impact the way we work and play. As blockchain savvy teams around the globe build and <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisonmccauley/2019/05/23/is-collaboration-the-new-competition-blockchains-flip-conventional-mba-wisdom/#7aa2ab8c52da\">gather allies</a>, projects could build, over time, to something pervasive and difficult to outrun.</p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/uqBBmQ8B7GQ\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",

Not least is the broadening realization that ML models can fail. And that’s why model debugging, the art and science of understanding and fixing problems in ML models, is so critical to the future of ML. Without being able to troubleshoot models when they underperform or misbehave, organizations simply won’t be able to adopt and deploy ML at scale.</p>\\n<p id=\"F1\">Because all ML models make mistakes, everyone who cares about ML should also care about model debugging.<a href=\"#_ftn1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> This includes C-suite executives, front-line data scientists, and risk, legal, and compliance personnel. This article is meant to be a short, relatively technical primer on what model debugging is, what you should know about it, and the basics of how to debug models in practice. These recommendations are based on our experience, both as a data scientist and as a lawyer, focused on managing the risks of deploying ML.</p>\\n<h2>What is model debugging?</h2>\\n<p id=\"F2\">Sometimes ML models are just plain wrong, but sometimes they’re wrong <em>and</em> socially discriminatory, or hacked, or simply unethical.<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a>,<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>,<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Current model assessment techniques, like cross-validation or receiver operator characteristic (ROC) and lift curves, simply don’t tell us about all the nasty things that can happen when ML models are deployed as part of large, complex, public-facing IT systems.<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>\\n<p id=\"F6\">That’s where model debugging comes in. Model debugging is an emergent discipline focused on finding and fixing problems in ML systems. In addition to newer innovations, the practice borrows from model risk management, traditional model diagnostics, and software testing. Model debugging attempts to test ML models like code (because they are usually code) and to probe sophisticated ML response functions and decision boundaries to detect and correct accuracy, fairness, security, and other problems in ML systems.<a href=\"#_ftn6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> Debugging may focus on a variety of failure modes (i.e., a lot can go wrong with ML models), including:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Opaqueness</strong>: for many failure modes, you need to understand what the model is doing in order to understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Crucially, transparency doesn’t guarantee trustworthy models. But transparency is typically a prerequisite for debugging writ large.</li>\\n<li id=\"F7\"><strong>Social discrimination:</strong> by now, there are many widely publicized incidences of social discrimination in ML. These can cause harm to the subjects of the discriminatory model’s decisions and substantial reputational or regulatory harms to the model’s owners.<a href=\"#_ftn7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a></li>\\n<li id=\"F8\"><strong>Security vulnerabilities</strong>: adversarial actors can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of an ML model or the data associated with the model, creating a host of undesirable outcomes. The study of security in ML is a growing field—and a growing problem, as we documented in a recent Future of Privacy Forum report.<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a></li>\\n<li><strong>Privacy harms</strong>: models can compromise individual privacy in a long (and growing) list of ways.<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> Data about individuals can be decoded from ML models long after they’ve trained on that data (through what’s known as inversion or extraction attacks, for example). Models may also violate the privacy of individuals by inferring sensitive attributes from non-sensitive data, among other harms.</li>\\n<li><strong>Model decay</strong>: ML models and data pipelines are notoriously “brittle.”<a href=\"#_ftn5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> This means unexpected input data or small changes over time in the input data or data pipeline can wreak havoc on a model’s performance.</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>The best way to prevent and prepare for these kinds of problems is model debugging. We’ll review methods for debugging below.</p>\\n<h2>How is debugging conducted today?</h2>\\n<p>There are at least four major ways for data scientists to find bugs in ML models: sensitivity analysis, residual analysis, benchmark models, and ML security audits.</p>\\n<p>While our analysis of each method may appear technical, we believe that understanding the tools available, and how to use them, is critical for all risk management teams. Anyone, of any technical ability, should be able to at least think about using model debugging techniques.</p>\\n<h3>Sensitivity analysis</h3>\\n<p id=\"F9\">Sensitivity analysis, sometimes called <em>what-if?</em> analysis, is a mainstay of model debugging. It’s a very simple and powerful idea: simulate data that you find interesting and see what a model predicts for that data. Because ML models can react in very surprising ways to data they’ve never seen before, it’s safest to test all of your ML models with sensitivity analysis.<a href=\"#_ftn9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> While it is relatively straightforward to conduct sensitivity analysis without a formal framework, the <a href=\"https://pair-code.github.io/what-if-tool/index.html#about\">What-If Tool</a> is a great way to start playing with certain kinds of models in the TensorFlow family. More structured approaches to sensitivity analysis include:</p>\\n<ul>\\n<li><strong>Adversarial example searches</strong>: this entails systematically searching for rows of data that evoke strange or striking responses from an ML model. Figure 1 illustrates an example adversarial search for an example credit default ML model. If you’re using Python and deep learning libraries, the <a href=\"https://github.com/tensorflow/cleverhans\">CleverHans</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/bethgelab/foolbox\">Foolbox</a> packages can also help you debug models and find adversarial examples.</li>\\n<li><strong>Partial dependence, accumulated local effect (ALE), and individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots</strong>: this involves systematically visualizing the effects of changing one or more variables in your model. There are a ton of packages for these techniques: <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ALEPlot/index.html\">ALEPlot</a>, <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DALEX/index.html\">DALEX</a>, <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ICEbox/index.html\">ICEbox</a>, <a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/iml/index.html\">iml</a>, and <a href=\"https://bgreenwell.github.io/pdp/index.html\">pdp</a> in R; and <a href=\"https://github.com/SauceCat/PDPbox\">PDPbox</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/AustinRochford/PyCEbox\">PyCEbox</a> in Python.</li>\\n<li><strong>Random attacks:</strong> exposing models to high volumes of random input data and seeing how they react. Random attacks can reveal all kinds of unexpected software and math bugs. <em>If you don’t know where to begin debugging an ML system, random attack is a great place to get started.</em></li>\\n</ul>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"Results from an adversarial example search\" src=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/12/figure1-2.jpg\"><figcaption><em>Figure 1: Results from an adversarial example search that show low most recent (PAY_AMT1) and low second most recent (PAY_AMT2) credit card payments result in strikingly high probabilities of default according to an example credit default ML model. Currency amounts reported in Taiwan dollars. Figure courtesy of Patrick Hall and H2O.ai.</em></figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Residual analysis</h3>\\n<p>Residual analysis is another well-known family of model debugging techniques. Residuals are a numeric measurement of model errors, essentially the difference between the model&#8217;s prediction and the known true outcome. Small residuals usually mean a model is right, and large residuals usually mean a model is wrong. Residual plots place input data and predictions into a two-dimensional visualization where influential outliers, data-quality problems, and other types of bugs often become plainly visible. The main drawback of residual analysis is that to calculate residuals, true outcomes are needed. That means it can be hard to work with residuals in some real-time model monitoring settings, but residual analysis should always be doable at model training time.</p>\\n<p id=\"F10\">Like in Figure 2, many discrimination detection techniques consider model errors as well, especially across different demographic groups. This basic bias detection exercise is sometimes called <em>disparate impact analysis</em>.<a href=\"#_ftn10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> The Gender Shades line of research is a great example of how analyzing errors across demographic groups is necessary for models that affect people.<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> There are a myriad of other tools available for discrimination detection. To learn more about testing ML models for discrimination, check out packages like <a href=\"https://github.com/dssg/aequitas\">aequitas</a>, <a href=\"http://aif360.mybluemix.net/\">AIF360</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/LASER-UMASS/Themis\">Themis</a>, and, more generally, the content created by the Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in ML (FATML) community.<a href=\"#_ftn11\"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>\\n<figure class=\"center\"><img alt=\"model discrimination\" src=\"https://d3ansictanv2wj.cloudfront.net/figure_2_hi-40b9150f5e227bea3057e51882749c1b.jpg\"><figcaption><em>Figure 2: Many types of errors analyzed across males and females for the example credit default model. While it’s a good sign that errors are similar for both males and females, this does not mean the model is free of discrimination. Figure courtesy of Patrick Hall and H2O.ai.</em></figcaption></figure>\\n<h3>Benchmark models</h3>\\n<p>Benchmark models are trusted, simple, or interpretable models to which ML models can be compared. It’s always a good idea to check that a new complex ML model does actually outperform a simpler benchmark model. Once an ML model passes this benchmark test, the benchmark model can serve as a solid debugging tool. Benchmark models can be used to ask questions like: “what predictions did my ML model get wrong that my benchmark model got right, and why?” Comparing benchmark model and ML model predictions in real time can also help to catch accuracy, fairness, or security anomalies as they occur.</p>\\n<h3>ML security audits</h3>\\n<p id=\"F12\">There are several known attacks against machine learning models that can lead to altered, harmful model outcomes or to exposure of sensitive training data.<a href=\"#_ftn8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a>,<a href=\"#_ftn12\"><sup>[12]</sup></a> Again, traditional model assessment measures don’t tell us much about whether a model is secure. In addition to other debugging steps, it may be prudent to add some or all of the known ML attacks into any white-hat hacking exercises or red-team audits an organization is already conducting.</p>\\n<h2>We found something wrong; what do we do?</h2>\\n<p>So you’ve implemented some of the systematic ways to find accuracy, fairness, and security problems in ML-based systems that we’ve discussed. You’ve even discovered a few problems with your ML model. What can you do? That’s where remediation strategies come in. We discuss seven remediation strategies below.</p>\\n<h3>Data augmentation</h3>\\n<p>ML models learn from data to become accurate, and ML models require data that’s truly representative of the entire problem space being modeled. If a model is failing, adding representative data into its training set can work wonders. Data augmentation can be a remediation strategy for discrimination in ML models, too. One major source of discrimination in ML is demographically unbalanced training data. If a model is going to be used on all kinds of people, it’s best to ensure the training data has a representative distribution of all kinds of people as well.</p>\\n<h3>Interpretable ML models and explainable ML</h3>\\n<p id=\"F13\">The debugging techniques we propose should work on almost any kind of ML-based predictive model. But they will be easier to execute on interpretable models or with explainable ML. For this reason, and others, we recommend interpretable and explainable ML for high-stakes use cases. Luckily, technological progress has been made toward this end in recent years. There are a lot of options for interpretable and accurate ML models and a lot of ways to explain and describe them.<a href=\"#_ftn13\"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>\\n<h3>Model editing</h3>\\n<p>Some ML models are designed to be interpretable so it is possible to understand how they work. Some of these models, like variants of decision trees or <a href=\"https://github.com/microsoft/interpret\">GA2M</a> (i.e., explainable boosting machines) can be directly editable by human users. If there’s something objectionable in the inner workings of a GA2M model, it’s not very hard to find it and change the final model equation to get rid of it. Other models might not be as easy to edit as GA2M or decision trees, but if they generate human-readable computer code, they can be edited.</p>\\n<h3>Model assertions</h3>\\n<p id=\"F14\">Model assertions can improve or override model predictions in real time.<a href=\"#_ftn14\"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Model assertions are business rules that act on model predictions themselves. Examples could include checking the age of a customer to whom a model recommends advertising alcoholic beverages, or checking for large prepayments for a prediction that says a high net worth individual is about to default.</p>\\n<h3>Discrimination remediation</h3>\\n<p id=\"F15\">There are a lot of ways to fix discrimination in ML models. Many non-technological solutions involve promoting a diversity of expertise and experience on data science teams, and ensuring diverse intellects are involved in all stages of model building.<a href=\"#_ftn15\"><sup>[15]</sup></a> Organizations should, if possible, require that all important data science projects include personnel with expertise in ethics, privacy, social sciences, or other related disciplines.</p>\\n<p>From a technical perspective, discrimination remediation methods fall into three major buckets: data pre-processing, model training and selection, and prediction post-processing. For pre-processing, careful feature selection, and sampling and reweighing rows to minimize discrimination in training data can be helpful.</p>\\n<p>For model training and selection, we recommend considering fairness metrics when selecting hyperparameters and decision cutoff thresholds. This may also involve training fair models directly by learning fair representations (LFR) and adversarial debiasing in <a href=\"http://aif360.mybluemix.net/\">AIF360</a>, or using dual objective functions that consider both accuracy and fairness metrics. Last, for prediction post-processing, changing model predictions after training, like reject-option classification in <a href=\"http://aif360.mybluemix.net/\">AIF360</a> or <a href=\"https://github.com/cosmicBboy/themis-ml\">Themis ML</a>, can also help to reduce unwanted bias.</p>\\n<h3>Model monitoring</h3>\\n<p>Model debugging is not a one-and-done task. The accuracy, fairness, or security characteristics of ML models are not static. They can change significantly over time based on the model’s operating environment. We recommend monitoring ML models for accuracy, fairness, and security problems at regular time intervals once they are deployed.</p>\\n<h3>Anomaly detection</h3>\\n<p>Strange, anomalous input and prediction values are always worrisome in ML, and can be indicative of an adversarial attack on an ML model. Luckily, anomalous inputs and predictions can be caught and corrected in real time using a variety of tools and techniques: data integrity constraints on input data streams, statistical process control methodologies on inputs and predictions, anomaly detection through <a href=\"https://towardsdatascience.com/credit-card-fraud-detection-using-autoencoders-in-h2o-399cbb7ae4f1\">autoencoders</a> and <a href=\"http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/if.html\">isolation forests</a>, and also by comparing ML predictions to benchmark model predictions.</p>\\n<h2>Conclusion and further reading</h2>\\n<p id=\"F16\">Everyone wants trustworthy ML models. And that means that as ML is more widely adopted, the importance of model debugging will only increase over time. That holds true for everyone from Kagglers to front-line data scientists to legal and risk management personnel and for ML consumers and decision subjects. Those interested in more details can dig deeper into the code on GitHub used to create the examples in this post.<a href=\"#_ftn16\"><sup>[16]</sup></a> Or, you can learn more about model debugging in the ML research community by checking out the 2019 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) Debugging Machine Learning Models workshop proceedings.<a href=\"#_ftn17\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Hopefully some of these techniques will work for you and your team.

       "     'value': '<p>Roughly a year ago, we wrote “<a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-machine-learning-means-for-software-development/\">What machine learning means for software development</a>.” In that article, we talked about Andrej Karpathy’s concept of <a href=\"https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35\">Software 2.0</a>. Karpathy argues that we’re at the beginning of a profound change in the way software is developed. Up until now, we’ve built systems by carefully and painstakingly telling systems exactly what to do, instruction by instruction. The process is slow, tedious, and error-prone; most of us have spent days staring at a program that should work, but doesn’t. And most of us have been surprised when some program that has been reliable for some time suddenly screws up at some slightly unexpected input. The last bug is always the one you find next; if someone hasn’t already said that, someone should have.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Karpathy suggests something radically different: with machine learning, we can stop thinking of programming as writing a step of instructions in a programming language like C or Java or Python. Instead, we can program by example. We can collect many examples of what we want the program to do and what not to do (examples of correct and incorrect behavior), label them appropriately, and train a model to perform correctly on new inputs. In short, we can use machine learning to automate software development itself.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>It’s time to evaluate what has happened in the year since we wrote that article. Are we seeing the first steps toward the adoption of Software 2.0? Yes, but so far, they’re only small steps. Most companies don’t have the AI expertise to implement Karpathy’s vision. Traditional programming is well understood. Training models isn’t well understood yet, at least not within companies that haven’t already invested significantly in technology (in general) or AI (in particular). Nor are building data pipelines and deploying ML systems well understood. The companies that are systematizing how they develop ML and AI applications are companies that already have advanced AI practices.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>That doesn’t mean we aren’t seeing tools to automate various aspects of software engineering and data science. Those tools are starting to appear, particularly for building deep learning models. We’re seeing continued adoption of tools like AWS’ <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/\">Sagemaker</a> and Google’s <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/automl/\">AutoML</a>. <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/01/17/googles-automl-lets-you-train-custom-machine-learning-models-without-having-to-code/\">AutoML Vision</a> allows you to build models without having to code; we’re also seeing code-free model building from <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/12/17452742/deep-learning-ai-learn-lobe-made-easy-coding\">startups</a> like <a href=\"https://mljar.com/\">MLJAR</a> and <a href=\"https://lobe.ai/\">Lobe</a>, and tools focused on computer vision, such as <a href=\"https://platform.ai/\">Platform.ai</a> and <a href=\"https://www.matroid.com/\">Matroid</a>. A sign that companies are scaling up their usage of ML and AI is that we are seeing the rise of data platforms aimed at accelerating the development and deployment of ML within companies that are growing teams focused on machine learning and AI. Several leaders in AI have described platforms they’ve built internally (such as Uber’s <a href=\"https://eng.uber.com/michelangelo/\">Michelangelo</a>, Facebook’s <a href=\"https://engineering.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/\">FBLearner</a>, Twitter’s <a href=\"https://cortex.twitter.com/\">Cortex</a>, and Apple’s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1909.05372.pdf\">Overton</a>); these companies are having an influence on other companies that are starting to build their own tools. Companies like <a href=\"https://databricks.com/\">Databricks</a> are building Software as a Service (SaaS) or on-premises tools for companies that aren’t ready to build their own platform.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We’ve also seen (and featured at O’Reilly’s AI Conference) <a href=\"https://www.snorkel.org/\">Snorkel</a>, an ML-driven tool for automated data labeling and synthetic data generation. <a href=\"http://www.holoclean.io/\">HoloClean</a>, another tool developed by researchers from Stanford, Waterloo, and Wisconsin, undertakes automatic error detection and repair. As Chris Ré <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/artificial-intelligence-conference/9781492050544/9781492050544-video324795\">said at our conference</a>, we’ve made a lot of progress in automating data collection and model generation; but labeling and cleaning data have stubbornly resisted automation. At O’Reilly’s AI Conference in Beijing, Tim Kraska of MIT <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/artificial-intelligence-conference/9781492050629/9781492050629-video325736\">discussed</a> how machine learning models have out-performed standard, well-known algorithms for database optimization, disk storage optimization, basic data structures, and even process scheduling. The hand-crafted algorithms you learned in school may cease to be relevant, because AI can do better. Rather than learning about sorting and indexing, the next generation of programmers may learn how to apply machine learning to these problems.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>One of the most suggestive projects we’ve seen has been <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/riselabs-autopandas-hints-at-automation-tech-that-will-change-the-nature-of-software-development/\">RISE Lab’s</a> <a href=\"https://autopandas.io/\">AutoPandas</a>. Given a set of inputs, and the outputs those inputs should produce, AutoPandas generates a program based on those inputs and outputs. This “programming by example” is an exciting step toward Software 2.0.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>What are the biggest obstacles to adoption? The same set of problems that AI and ML are facing everywhere else (and that, honestly, every new technology faces): lack of skilled people, trouble finding the right use cases, and the difficulty of finding data. That’s one reason Software 2.0 is having the greatest influence on data science: that’s where the skilled people are. Those are the same people who know how to collect and preprocess data, and who know how to define problems that can realistically be solved by ML systems. With AutoPandas, and automated tools for optimizing database queries, we’re just starting to see AI tools that are aimed at software developers.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>Machine learning also comes with certain <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/managing-risk-in-machine-learning/\">risks</a>, and many businesses may not be willing to accept those risks. Traditional programming is by no means risk-free, but at least those risks are familiar. Machine learning raises the question of explainability. You may not be able to explain why your software does what it does, and there are many application domains (for example, medicine and law) where explainability is essential. Reliability is also a problem: it’s not possible to build a machine learning system that is 100% accurate. If you train a system to manage inventory, how many of that system’s decisions will be incorrect? It might make fewer errors than a human, but we’re more comfortable with the kinds of errors humans make. We’re only starting to understand the <a href=\"https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/strengthening-deep-neural/9781492044949/\">security</a> implications of machine learning, and wherever data is involved, privacy questions are almost certain to follow. Understanding and addressing the risks of ML and AI will require cross-functional teams; these teams need to encompass not only people with different kinds of expertise (security, privacy, compliance, ethics, design, and domain expertise), but also people from different social and cultural backgrounds. Risks that one socio-cultural group accepts without thinking twice are often completely unacceptable to those with different backgrounds; think, for example, what the use of face identification means to people in Hong Kong.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>These problems, though, are solvable. <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/what-are-model-governance-and-model-operations/\">Model governance, model operations</a>, <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/sustaining-machine-learning-in-the-enterprise/\">data provenance, and data lineage</a> are becoming hot topics for people and organizations that are implementing AI solutions. Understanding where your data comes from and how it has been modified, along with understanding how your models are evolving over time, is a critical step in addressing safety. Governance and provenance will become even more important as data use becomes subject to regulation; and we’re starting to see data-driven businesses <a href=\"https://www.oreilly.com/radar/managing-machine-learning-in-the-enterprise-lessons-from-banking-and-health-care/\">follow the lead of companies in highly regulated industries</a>, such as banking and health care.</p>\\n\\n\\n\\n<p>We are at the edge of a revolution in how we build software. How far will that revolution extend? We don’t know; it’s hard to imagine AI systems designing good user interfaces for humans–though once designed, it’s easy to imagine AI building those interfaces. Nor is it easy to imagine AI systems designing good APIs for programmatic access to applications. But it’s clear that AI can and will have a big influence on how we develop software. Perhaps the biggest change won’t be a reduction in the need for programmers, but in freeing programmers to think more about what we’re doing, and why. What are the right problems to solve? How do we create software that’s useful to everyone? That’s ultimately a more important problem than building yet another online shopping app. And if Software 2.0 lets us pay more attention to those questions, it will be a revolution that’s truly worthwhile.<br></p>\\n<img src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~4/nbtg4a0T0UI\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\" alt=\"\"/>'}],\n",
